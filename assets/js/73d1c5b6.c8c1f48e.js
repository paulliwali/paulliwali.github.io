is a place to store facts and ideas that you learned but may not need on a day-to-day basis.\nThe reason to have a second brain is to keep your primary brain's cognitive activity free of clutter and not be bogged down with remembering numbers, names, and details.\nIt can be focused on the process of understanding and reasoning knowledge.\nBeing an avid podcast listener, I was also aware that a lot of information just goes in one ear and out the other.\nThe stories, quotes, and ideas from the podcasts were very engaging in the moment and I felt that I was ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"never")," going to forget it.\nBut time and time again, I failed to recall all the details when I want to bring up the story in a conversation."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"I

take Smart Notes]","] which describes the process of a slip-box system that was used by Niklas Luhmann to write more prolifically.\nThis note-taking system is a way of organizing thoughts and intermingling ideas to inspire new ones.\nThe emphasis of this system is on the web of connections made between each thought.\nAlso, it encourages you to write small ready-made pieces each time and when you want to write a longer piece - you just have to connect the pieces.\nThis way, the daunting task of writing a full-length piece is broken down into smaller efforts each day."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,'This method is also known as the Zettelkasten Method which is German for "slip-box", and the original implementation uses index cards.\nEven though I love nothing more than an analog system, it is probably way too much of a hassle to maintain and update.\nAnd, the pain of searching for something is probably not worth the novelty.\nSo I turned to software.\nI initially started with ',(0,o.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.zettlr.com/"},"Zettlr"),'.\nA decent program that is a markdown editor with bi-directional references and tagging.\nBut I didn\'t get that

everything I attempt to write down but doesn't give me a good way to re-organize.\nI started to feel like it was a messy drawer where I can easily dump notes but was difficult to see how many notes I had and find the right notes at the right time.\nThe web of notes kept growing outwards and they were not strengthening in connection with each other - the promise of generating new ideas was not
