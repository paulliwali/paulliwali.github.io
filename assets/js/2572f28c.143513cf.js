common technology used in this layer: CSV, JSON, parquet.\nThe pros and cons of these file format is the trade-off between human usability and computation performance.\nIn general, if the file format

becomes corrupted there are always backups.\nSo imagine several filing cabinets with the same information.\nS3 was built for scalability by storing objects with keys, kind of like each cabinet stores a "bucket" of information.\nUsually people prefer to use HDFS for on-prem use cases because it allows horizontal scaling by adding more machines as opposed to vertical scaling by replacing servers
