This compilation might be a bit shorter, with some more profound insights than the usual bite-sized TILs, but I hope you\'ll find it an enjoyable read.\\n\\n1. Scare quotes\\n    * Quotation marks put around a term or sentence when it is not required to spread doubt\\n    > Some examples that come to my mind are \\"global warming\\", \\"pandemic\\", \\"bug\\"\\n\\n1. Bit Rot\\n    * When code is not actively maintained, also known as software rot\\n    >  A similar concept for data engineering exists and I think a good name for it would be data rot\\n      * Where people forget what specific fields mean or problems that are embedded in the data\\n      * Stems from embedding custom or business logic into the extract-transform-load pipeline for the sake of easier queries for the end-users\\n      * This behavior can quickly degrade into long-term maintainability and usability issues and cause data rot\\n\\n1. Doumbek\\n    * ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Goblet_drum_01.jpg)\\n    * Egyptian drum, a mesmerizing percussion instrument producing \\"Doom,\\" \\"Tak,\\" and \\"Pa\\" sounds\\n\\n1. Chrono-urbanism\\n    * A way of planning the city around *time* instead of *space*\\n    * The Northstar for chrono-urbanism city planning would be the \\"[15-minute city](https://www.15minutecity.com/blog/hello)\\" where access to essential needs of a person are met within 15 minutes\\n        * A secondary goal would be to meet this not just physically but also financially\\n    * Seattle is exploring this concept in their [20-year vision plan](https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/ongoing-initiatives/seattle-2035-comprehensive-plan)\\n\\n1. [Russell\'s Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox)\\n    * Bertrand Russell in 1901 showed that every set theory that contains an unrestricted comprehension principle leads to contradictions\\n        * Discovered independently by Ernst Zermelo in 1899\\n    * Unrestricted comprehension principle is that for any sufficiently well-defined property, there is the set of all and only the objects that have that property\\n\\n    > So that was probably very confusing, tbh that was a lot of copying and pasting, so trying to explain this paradox in layman\'s terms, I have two examples\\n\\n    1. Barber paradox: a barber is \\"one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves\\" and the question is: does the barber shave themself?\\n        * If the barber shaves themselves then by the definition above, he is no longer a barber\\n        * But if a barber doesn\'t shave themself then he belongs in the group of people that needs to be shaved by a barber which is themself\\n    1. The other is: that all rules have exceptions\\n        * If this is a rule, then there must be an exception where there is a set of rules without exceptions\\n        * However, if that were to be true then the original statement would be false\\n\\n1. Punch card machines predate computers\\n    * Used in the late 18th and early 19th century for looms to weave different patterns on clothes and it was later used by IBM in the 1890s to program code\\n    > I have always associated punch cards with the old computers that took up an entire floor and thinking about handing in computer assignments that were in a binder full of punch cards and accidentally feeding them in the wrong order and having the program crash\\n\\n1. [Shoshikantetsu](https://asnewman.github.io/shoshikantetsu)\\n    * To carry out something as intended when you have low motivation\\n    > I need to remember this in the latter half of the year when most of the New Year resolutions are going by the wayside!\\n\\n1. Stroad\\n    * A portmanteau (an old TIL) of street and road\\n    * Coined by the American civil engineer Charles Marohn to describe poorly designed infrastructure that fails to do the job of either a street or road so it ends up doing both poorly\\n    * A street is meant to be a destination in itself with shops and restaurants to promote pedestrian use\\n    * A road is meant to transport people from point A to B\\n    > Personally my favourite TIL of the year!\\n\\n1. [Cunningham\'s Law](https://xkcd.com/386/)\\n    * The internet\'s ironic wisdom: To find the right answer, post the wrong one\\n    > The obligatory xkcd reference. Not sure who Cunningham is or if it\'s a reference to something.\\n\\n1. Ferrite bead\\n    * Remember those bulgy plastic before the plug that looks like this ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Cable_end.JPG/220px-Cable_end.JPG)\\n    * It is meant to suppress high-frequency electronic noise in the circuit which prevents electromagnetic interference from and to the device\\n\\n1. Da Hong Pao Mother Trees\\n    * ![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/bd777d_51bff6f886f341c08b2f1ca325c72ebd~mv2.jpg)\\n    * The origin of Da Hong Pao (big red robe) tea is from a story where a scholar was on his way to take the imperial exam, the Gaokao of olden days, but was exhausted from the journey. A monk brewed some tea and he was able to continue his journey and ended up with the top score. On the way home, he paid tribute to the tree where the tea was from by putting his red robe from attaining the top score around it\\n    * There are 6 trees in the rocks of Jiu Long Ke in Wuyi, Fujian which have been around for 360 years\\n    * According to folklore, the teas from these trees were sent as tribute to the Emperor\\n        * In 1998, 20g of tea produced from these trees was auctioned for 20,000 USD\\n        * It is no longer allowed to harvest from these trees as they are protected national heritage\\n\\n1. Hemingway Cats\\n    * 6-toed cats (polydactyl) cats that live on Hemingway\'s property\\n        * They all carry the gene but half exhibit the physical trait\\n    * Ernest Hemingway was given a 6-toed cat by a ship\'s captain\\n    * His residence in Key West is relatively isolated, so the descendants are kept relatively within the same gene pool\\n\\n1. Whale Falls\\n    * The phenomenon where a large whale carcass falls into the deep ocean floor relatively intact\\n      * The carcass can house a complex localized ecosystem for sea organisms for decades\\n    * First discovered in 1987, by the submersible vessels that were used in the Titanic Salvage\\n\\n1. Duck Tape\\n    * It originates from duck cloth (from the Dutch word doek) which is a heavy woven fabric that can be made waterproof by coating it with wax\\n    * Strips of these duck cloth were used as decoration or to strengthen shoes\\n    > Settling the age-old debate: it\'s \\"duck\\" tape not \\"duct\\" tape\\n\\n1. Nerfing\\n    > Always knew that it was a gaming term that means to tune down the ability or the mechanic of a character, opposite of buffing\\n    * Learned that it is a reference to the Nerf guns being the soft version of the actual thing\\n\\n1. Bone Dry Martini\\n    * Gin in a chilled glass, sometimes washed with vermouth just to be discarded before pouring in the gin\\n\\n1. Ergodicity\\n    > This is gonna be a long one but super worthwhile\\n\\n    * An ergodic system is when the average outcome of a cohort is the **same** as the average outcome of the individual over time\\n        * For example, if there are 100 gamblers in a casino and they make bets with the odd 1/100 gamblers will go bankrupt. But this means that, if gambler number 28 goes bust, it does not affect gambler number 29. Using the standard cost-benefit analysis * this activity would have a good expected average return\\n        * However, if this is applied to a single person across 100 days with the same odds. This person can go bust on day 28 and have no money for future days.\\n        * This means that the ensemble probability can\'t be applied to the time probability of a single individual * not an ergodic system!\\n    * Usually, financial decisions *assume* an ergodic system when in reality it is *actually* non-ergodic\\n        * For example, for retirement planning we often assume a constant rate of return on investment. However, if you layer in the actual sequence of the rate of return that averages out to the constant rate on top of your anticipated expenses - you could potentially be in a situation where you have to take out investments when it is not favorable\\n    * Relating to the idea from Nassim Taleb\'s book Antifragile, there is an idea that some things respond negatively to volatility while others respond positively\\n        * Things that respond positively are antifragile and also ergodic\\n\\n1. Abilene Paradox\\n    * When the group makes a decision contrary to all the individuals\' preferences\\n    * Stems from thinking that others in the group would prefer something even though they personally don\'t\\n    > Maybe you\'ve experienced this as a couple where you end up making a decision that you mistakenly thought the other person wanted\\n\\n1. PF Chang, Haagen-Dazs\\n    * Examples of a marketing tactic to give the audience an expectation for the product\\n    * The PF in PF Chang stands for Paul Fleming one of the two co-founders, the other is Philip Chiang\\n    >  But when the initials are used as the restaurant name it was able to hide the non-Asian roots, kind of similar to JK Rowling hiding her gender by abbreviating her name because of the gender discrimination that was in the publishing world\\n    * Haagen-Dazs was invented by the creators to \\"sound Danish\\"\\n        * A tribute to their good treatment of Jews during WWII\\n\\n1. [Chianti Rooster Legend](https://www.beginnerwineguide.com/what-is-the-story-behind-that-rooster-on-the-neck-of-the-wine-bottle/)\\n    * The area between Florence and Siena in Italy was under contention and after decades of battles, they decided to settle it once and for all\\n    * Decided to settle it with their knights race to the boundary at the sound of a rooster\'s crow in the mornings\\n    * They were able to choose their own roosters and the Florentines picked a black rooster that they starved for days\\n    * Because of the starvation, it croaked way before sunrise, and the Florentine knight raced to only 20KM away from the Sienna walls\\n    > Yes I know it\'s just folklore but also hilarious to think the Siennians (?) were just like, okay we accept you won that fair and square\\n\\n1. Why is the glacier water blue\\n    * Minerals from glaciers, known as glacier flour, absorb short wavelengths, giving glacier water its striking blue hue\\n    > for reference: ROYGBIV\\n\\n1. [Noctalgia](https://www.space.com/light-pollution-loss-dark-skies-noctalgia)\\n    * Means sky grief\\n    * A new term to describe the loss of the dark sky due to light pollution\\n    > Reminds me of the words from the dictionary obscure sorrows\\n\\n1. When pigs fly\\n    * An adynaton, which is a hyperbole that is so extreme to imply the impossible\\n    * Other adynatons include:\\n        * \\"I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek\\"\\n        * \\"Not before Hell freezes over\\"\\n        * \\"When the Leafs win the Cup\\" ;)\\n    > There seems to be a trend of animal references (when cows fly, when hens grow teeth, when cow coughs, when an owl\'s tail blooms, when donkeys fly, when fish climb poplar trees)\\n\\n1. Drunk bears in Montana\\n    1. There is a railroad near Glacier National Park where the trains will sometimes spill grain and it gets fermented from the sun. The bears in the area would come and get drunk off the fermented grain and either tries to outrun the train on the track or would be wasted on the track which leads to their deaths\\n    * No preventative action has been actively taken right now because the rail company believes that grizzly bears will be delisted as a threatened species\\n    > Of the measures that were discussed the only one that seems reasonable is to not load the train in a way that would cause spillage. This seems obvious enough since the grain seems to be lost on the road anyway\\n\\n1. Footgun\\n    * A programming joke for a feature that results in the user shooting themself in the foot\\n\\n1. Schrodinger\'s Cat\\n    > The common usage of this reference today is that it is an explainer for quantum mechanics but in actuality, it was a criticism of Copenhagen\'s interpretation which included the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic\\n    * Erwin Schrodinger came up with this paradoxical example to illustrate the *absurdity* of Copenhagen\'s interpretation where the cat can be *simultaneously* alive and dead in the box that contains a radiation monitor that can release poison\\n    * The collapse of the states happens when one looks into the box but when exactly did the quantum superposition end?\\n\\n1. Why is the Napa Valley a great place to grow grapes for wine\\n    * Diuaral temperature range\\n        * The big temperature swing from day to night allows for the grapes to ripen for longer on the vine as the low temperature pauses the growth of the grapes\\n        * This gives the grapes a \\"long hang time\\" to develop more flavor for wine\\n        * The temperature swing comes from the cooling effect of the Pacific Ocean\\n        * Winegrowers will use fans to move the hotter air above the ground down during very cold nights to prevent frost from forming\\n    * Diversity of soil types\\n        * As a result of geological activity 150 million years ago\\n        * It is also well-drained and deep\\n    * Policy\\n        * It became the first agricultural reserve in the US in 1968 which has stringent protections of the land for wine growing only\\n\\n1. Why are there roses at the end of vineyard rows\\n    * There are several explanations but could all be urban legends\\n    * Disease detection system\\n        * Roses are more sensitive to disease or insect infestation and could serve as an early warning system for the health of the vineyard\\n        * But winegrowers have also said if there are insects on the roses there is probably not enough time to protect the grapes\\n    * Turn signal for the horses or oxen\\n        * Back when farm animals were used, roses were used to ensure they didn\'t cut across the rows and damage the grapes\\n\\n1. Madeira Wine\\n    * Fortified wine made on the Portuguese Madeira Islands by oxidizing wine through heat and aging\\n    * This produces wine that can be stored for a long long time, for decades and even centuries\\n        * The oldest known vintage is a 1715 Terrantez\\n    * The Solera process is a way to age liquids by fractional blending of older products with younger ones to increase the average age\\n        * It means \\"on the ground\\" in Spanish because the fractional blending transfers from between barrels from the top to bottom\\n\\n    > The Madeira wine produced in Napa uses this process with a very old vintage that was stored and forgotten when the family hid their alcohol during the prohibition and pivoted to another business\\n\\n1. Kona Coffee\\n    * Grown exclusively in Kona, Hawaii on the Big Island\\n    * First planted by Don Francisco de Paula Marin in 1817 and popularized by Samuel Ruggles in 1828\\n        * Started to switch the local sugar plantation owners over to growing coffee\\n        * But destroyed by weather and pests in the 1850s\\n    * Hermann Widemann in 1892 planted a variety of Guatemalan bean, which is called Kona Typica today\\n        * Then coffee prices crashed in 1899 which caused most coffee growers to switch back to sugar again\\n        * Brought back into popularity during WWII and created another boom in the industry on Kona\\n    * Micheal Norton sold cheap coffee under the name \\"100% Kona Coffee\\" during 1993 and 1996\\n        * The coffee farmers of Kona formed the Kona Coffee Council to protect the quality and reputation of Kona Coffee\\n    * Quality and standard to be Kona Coffee\\n        * Must be hand-picked\\n        * Grown on volcanic soil in the Kona region full of nitrates, phosphates, iron, and manganese\\n        * Harvested late in the season to ensure ripeness\\n        * The western slopes of Big Island where Kona is located also provide the ideal environment for coffee growing as the plants get abundant sun but also protection from flooding and excess sun from the hills and clouds\\n\\n1. Pleonasm\\n    * Redundancy in words\\n        * Sometimes it is intentionally used to create emphasis but sometimes it is a result of incorporating foreign words either through trade, travel, or colonialism\\n\\n    > A few we are all familiar with are \\"Chai tea\\", \\"Naan bread\\" or \\"Queso cheese\\"\\n\\n    * But there are a lot more examples\\n        * Geography related\\n            * The El Capitan -> The \\"the\\" Capitan\\n            * Lake Tahoe -> Lake **Da ow** a ga -> Lake \\"edge of the lake\\"\\n            * Lake Michigan -> Lake Michigama -> Lake \\"large lake\\"\\n            * Mississippi River -> Misi-sipi River -> \\"Big river\\" River\\n        * Sports related\\n            * The Los Angeles Angels -> The \\"the\\" \\"angels\\" Angels\\n        * Acronym related\\n            * PIN number\\n            * Please RSVP\\n            * SI System\\n            * RAM memory\\n\\n1. A* algorithm\\n    * A weighted Dijkstra\'s algorithm that makes it much more efficient\\n    * The weighting can be thought of as changing the height or potential of the nodes based on the distance to the destination and results in changing the bidirectional edge\'s length\\n\\n1. Island Gigantism\\n    * The curious phenomenon of island-dwelling animals growing larger than their mainland counterparts.\\n    * Potentially caused by the lack of predators which a smaller body is needed for survival\\n    * Or potentially the larger body is needed to survive the scarce resources on the island or the harsher environments\\n\\n1. Effective Altruism\\n    * Started as a movement in Oxford that aims to maximize the good as much as possible\\n    * This could mean taking actions that can lead to gaining the ability to enable someone/something to do more good than doing the good themselves because it\'s ineffective\\n        * An extreme example would be prioritizing the actions that lead to great amounts of wealth so that you can donate to organizations that are doing good instead of joining the organization to do good\\n\\n    > The recent poster boy of this movement was Sam Bankman-Fried. So that wasn\'t a good look\\n\\n1. Six nines in pi\\n    * A famous coincidence that at the 762nd decimal place of pi, there are 6 nines\\n    * Sometimes called \\"Feynman point\\" but it is not clear when Feynman made this reference\\n    * The position of the first 9 repeated nines is at 564,665,206\\n\\n1. Diehard tests\\n    * A battery of statistical tests for the randomness quality of a random number generator\\n    * Side note: true randomness is unintuitive to us because we are sensitive to patterns\\n        * We would see repeated numbers as patterns and assume true \\"randomness\\" should give us new and yet-to-be-seen numbers\\n        * But if we used common sense and imagine there is a fair six-sided dice, after a number has appeared the probability that the next roll will be a new one would not change, especially not increased\\n        * A common user expectation for Spotify shuffle or random photo function is to not have repeated results but in reality, the true random behavior would be for the results to be repeated more often as more of the results are discovered\\n    * Developed by George Marsaglia in 1995 and extended to the dieharder tests\\n    * Some interesting things\\n        * Birthday spacings: the spacing between the points should be asymptotically exponentially distributed * based on the birthday paradox\\n        * Monkey tests: treat a sequence of some number of bits as \\"words\\", and the number of \\"words\\" that do not appear should follow a known distribution * based on the infinite monkey theorem\\n\\n1. Wiki\\n    * Hawaiian word for \\"quick\\"\\n    * The free shuttle bus at the Honolulu Airport is named Wiki Wiki Shuttle, which is an example of repeating a word for emphasis known as epizeuxis or palilogia\\n    * The first wiki, user-editable website was named WikiWikiWeb as the creator Ward Cunningham originally intended to name it QuickWeb\\n    * Wikipedia is a portmanteau of wiki and encyclopedia\\n\\n1.

The reason to have a second brain is to keep your primary brain\'s cognitive activity free of clutter and not be bogged down with remembering numbers, names, and details. It can be focused on the process of understanding and reasoning knowledge.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nBeing an avid podcast listener, I was also aware that a lot of information just goes in one ear and out the other. The stories, quotes, and ideas from the podcasts were very engaging in the moment and I felt that I was *never* going to forget it. But time and time again, I failed to recall all the details when I want to bring up the story in a conversation.\\n\\nI needed a way to store and access facts, so I can keep my brain free of clutter to focus on cognitive thinking.\\n\\nI was researching this one day and found a book called [\u201cHow to take Smart Notes\\"](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes) which describes the process of a slip-box system that was used by Niklas Luhmann to write more prolifically. This note-taking system is a way of organizing thoughts and intermingling ideas to inspire new ones. The emphasis of this system is on the web of connections made between each thought. Also, it encourages you to write small ready-made pieces each time and when you want to write a longer piece - you just have to connect the pieces. This way, the daunting task of writing a full-length piece is broken down into smaller efforts each day.\\n\\nThis method is also known as the Zettelkasten Method which is German for \\"slip-box\\", and the original implementation uses index cards. Even though I love nothing more than an analog system, it is probably way too much of a hassle to maintain and update. And, the pain of searching for something is probably not worth the novelty.\\n\\nSo I turned to software.\\n\\nI initially started with [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/). A decent program that is a markdown editor with bi-directional references and tagging. But I didn\'t get that \\"joy\\" factor when using it, it felt like a tool designed and intended for academic use.\\n\\n![zettlr](zettlr.webp)\\n\\nThen I discovered [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) which is an online app that had a strong community behind it. This web app made creating and linking notes extremely easy and the interface was clean to start using without much friction but provided lots of depth for customization. I got into customizing the look and feel of it and had several templates to make daily note entries, book reviews, article summaries, and TIL entries. But I started to feel that the system is doing a good job collecting everything I attempt to write down but doesn\'t give me a good way to re-organize. I started to feel like it was a messy drawer where I can easily dump notes but was difficult to see how many notes I had and find the right notes at the right time. The web of notes kept growing outwards and they were not strengthening in connection with each other - the promise of generating new ideas was not fulfilled.\\n\\n![roam-research](roam.webp)\\n\\nIn search of this filling of control, I decided to try [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). A full-fledged desktop app that looks like a glorified markdown editor, but has lots of small features that make untangling this mess of a web inside my second brain considerably easier.\\n\\n![obsidian](obsidian-promo.webp)\\n\\nThe first thing I did was export and import all my notes from Roam, and Obsidian has a very helpful markdown importer tool to automatically reformat the syntax from Roam to Obsidian. Then, I reorganize all my existing notes into the `slip-box` folder which is divided like so:\\n\\n```\\nslip-box/\\n\u251c\u2500 reference-notes/\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 highlights-from-article.md\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 highlights-from-blog.md\\n\u251c\u2500 literature-notes/\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 idea-1-explained-in-my-own-words.md\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 idea-2-explained-in-my-own-words.md\\n\u251c\u2500 permanent-notes/\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 2a-different-idea-explained.md\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 1a-explanation-of-idea.md\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 1a1-tangent-from-1a.md\\n```\\n\\nMost of the notes I had got dumped into `reference-notes`. There was also a small tree of permanent notes growing that I had forgotten about! It was lost in the woods of Roam and I re-read those and moved them into [permanent-notes]. Then I installed some community plugins to automate my daily notes routine. I used [calendar], [dataview], and [templater] in conjunction with [daily notes] to automagically create a daily note with a habit tracker, journal section, ephemeral notes for brain dumping, and dynamic links to notes I created or touched during the day.\\n\\nWith all this in place, I am starting to feel at home in my second brain.\\n\\n![obsidian-personal](obsidian.webp)\\n\\n> Note: Obsidian v1.0.3 on Mac M1 has this long loading time when coming out of hibernation after not using the app for a while.

I was planning a move to San Francisco and right before I was starting to pack I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8o8-EdZY0) where Matt D\u2019avella (kind of a modern-influencer minimalist) counted everything he owned. While I am by no means a minimalist, I do spend a lot of time debating whether I should purchase something or try my best to make things I already own to be as multifunctional as possible. For example, my longboard doubles up as my shoe-rack or just coffee mugs instead of different sizes and shapes for holding different types of liquids.\\n\\n![dogs-playing](dogs-playing.webp)\\n\\nmy dog playing with her friend, the only shot of my longboard shoe-rack\\n\\nOn top of multi-purposing, whenever I want to purchase anything new, I usually write it down on one of several shopping lists I have on my phone and evaluate the need for it by how frequently I try to re-add this item when an instance where I felt like my life would be much easier if I could use that item. Since I have kind of this reduction approach to buying material things, I thought it could also mean I don\u2019t own too many things - so it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to count everything up while I packed. Right?\\n\\nGround rules:\\n\\n* pair of things counted as one thing\\n* multi-paged documents counted as one thing (like how I would count a book)\\n* wires used for purposes other than power counted as separate things\\n* batteries where I have replacements of count as separate things\\n* consumables - food or products - didn\u2019t count.\\n\\nHere is the breakdown.\\n\\n![count-of-things](count-of-things.webp)\\n\\nSurprisingly, \u201cclothing\u201d was the largest category at nearly 30% with 153 items. I wasn\u2019t expecting this because I thought I kept quite a lean closet with just basic items that I wear everyday. Also add in the fact that it is sunny all-year around in California I trimmed out most of my wet/cold/hailing/snowing/depressing clothing from Canada.\\n\\nI was expecting kitchen to be in number one spot because I own a few too many coffee mugs and thought that there is just a minimum number of essential kitchen equipments you need if you are cooking at home regularly.\\n\\nHowever, these two categories are probably the least notable to someone who is trying to guesstimate how many things they might own. Because they are often organized away in shelves and take up little space compared to furniture, electronics and decor. While these items do take up more space, I only own a combined 81 items in these three categories. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of underestimating because those are the obvious large items you can easily count.\\n\\nWas this whole thing a waste of time? Well depends. I might do this every time I move so I can get a sense if I am getting bloated with more items or not. Even if I don\u2019t end up doing that it was still kind of interesting to see how many things you own and really consider how they add to your life."},{"id":"til2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/til2021","editUrl":"https://github.com/paulliwali/paulliwali.github.io/tree/main/blog/blog/2022-01-24-til2021/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-24-til2021/index.md","title":"Things I TIL\'ed in 2021","description":"I always lament the fact that I forgot all the random things I learned over the year, so in 2021 I made an effort to note down the things I learned just to make this post at the end of the year to look back and remember it again.","date":"2022-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"til","permalink":"/blog/tags/til"}],"readingTime":14.8,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Deng","title":"Magpie","url":"https://github.com/paulliwali","imageURL":"https://github.com/paulliwali.png","key":"pdeng","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"til2021","title":"Things I TIL\'ed in 2021","authors":"pdeng","tags":["til"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How many things do I own?","permalink":"/blog/how-many-things"},"nextItem":{"title":"Brew Logs 2018","permalink":"/blog/brew-logs-2018"}},"content":"I always lament the fact that I forgot all the random things I learned over the year, so in 2021 I made an effort to note down the things I learned just to make this post at the end of the year to look back and remember it again.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSo the first ever TIL annual review is for the year 2021, which might be remembered as the year where we thought COVID was over and the world will go back to being \u201cnormal\u201d but it pulled an uno reverse on us and now we are in lockdown ~~#4~~ #5 and booster ~~#2~~ #3.

The subtle honey and black leaf aromas were more prominent in the Perger method, whereas the acidity dominated the taste profile in the 40/60 method. Because of the interesting aromas with this particular bean, the Perger method is preferred.\\n\\n## May 2018\\n\\nAfter almost two weeks without proper coffee, I bought some beans from Sumatra, Indonesia to try. It was brewed in the Chemex with the usual ratio of 1:16.7, and the resulting brew had a slightly juicy body that gets sour the more sips you take. The first notes were definitely earthy and herbal - the card indicated tobacco as one of the notes - but obviously I can\u2019t start to tell the difference tobacco, cedar and wood. Then the subsequent notes are sharp, dry and acidic.\\n\\nNot sure if I enjoyed this one, it is not a combination I particularly enjoy. Which means I probably should write a mental note here - **DON\u2019T BUY SUMATRA INDONESIAN BEANS AGAIN!**\\n\\n## August 2018 (Pour over cold brew)\\n\\n* Beans: Kicking horse 454 horsepower\\n* Grind Size: 10\\n* Coffee Portion: 25g\\n* Water Portion: 200 ml\\n* Ice portion: 250 g\\n* Brew Time: ~2:00\\n* Taste: Strong, oily and bitter\\n* Rate: 7/10\\n\\nDuring the summertime, I prefer to cold brew my coffee. This year I learned about Japanese cold pour over - which is much faster to prepare compared to the traditional cold brew. Instead of brewing overnight, Japanese cold pour over uses ice to instantly cool the hot coffee to a refreshing temperature.\\n\\nTo make this, you start by heating the vessel and wet the filter paper with boiling water. Then you add about ~150g of ice into the vessel before making any coffee. Then you slowly pour about 200ml of water over finely grind coffee beans with the usual bloom and pour steps. As the final drips of water is filtered through, you add about ~100g of ice into the coffee to finish.\\n\\nAt the end you have a cup of nicely chilled coffee to start the summer day.\\n\\n## v60 Pour Methods\\nAbout 6 months ago, I got a Hario v60 dripper for my morning brews. Since I am the only coffee drinker in the house, making a single cup with the 6-cup Chemex seems awfully wasteful. With the smaller dripper, it allowed me to explore different pour methods and test their differences in my daily cup of coffee.\\n\\nI use the Baratza Encore on setting 21 to grind the beans for all of the pour methods.\\n\\n### The Perger Method\\n\\n* Coffee - 12g\\n* Water - 200ml\\n* Pour - 50ml bloom, 50ml @ 30s, 100ml @60s\\n\\nMatt Perger\'s technique is very simple and easy to replicate. It produces a softer cup with less accentuation to the sweetness and acidity of the beans. I usually make a cup with 27g of coffee while keeping the same coffee:water ratio. This method scales well with different amounts of coffee because dividing the water into three distinct pours allow control without being too finicky.\\n\\n### 4-6 Method\\n\\n* Coffee - 20g\\n* Water - 300ml\\n* Pour - 40% of water in two pours, 60% of water in as many pours as you want\\n\\nThis award winning technique by Tetsu Kasuya is nuanced and more difficult to perform. However, I love the precision this pour gives to the flavor of the final cup. The idea of this method is the 40% component determines the balance between acidity and sweetness. The more water one uses in the first pour of this component, the more acidic the final cup will be, and vice versa. The 60% component determines the strength of the coffee. If one divides the 60% of water with more number of pours, the stronger the coffee will be. Since this method also calls for a slightly higher coffee:water ratio, the resulting cup is more flavorful. I always chose to use this method with a fresh batch of beans to experience the palette for the first time.\\n\\n### Continuous Pour\\n\\n* Coffee - 27g\\n* Water - 450ml\\n* Pour - initial bloom, then pour the rest slowly in a circular pattern, aim for 2:00 - 2:30 brew time\\n\\nInstead of pouring water in distinct batches and waiting for each batch of water to completely dissipate through the grounds, this method continuously add water after the bloom step. Begin by pre-wetting the ground with 75g or so of water (depends on how much coffee there is). Actively dig through the grounds to ensure there are no dry spots and the gases are released from the freshly grind beans. Then pouring in slow and steady circles around the center of the v60, near but not on the edge of the grounds. Allow water to build up as high as possible without spilling. Rao spin can be achieved through this continuous pour. The Rao spin is a way to achieve a flatter bed to allow for even extraction (although not actually invented by Scott Rao). Another way to achieve a flatter bed is to carefully thump the v60 down on the cup and gravity should even out the grinds. Although this method doesn\'t allow for customization of the flavor, it is consistent in producing the same cup over and over again."},{"id":"brew-logs-2019","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/brew-logs-2019","editUrl":"https://github.com/paulliwali/paulliwali.github.io/tree/main/blog/blog/2021-05-23-brew-logs-2019.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-05-23-brew-logs-2019.md","title":"Brew Logs 2019","description":"February 2019","date":"2021-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"coffee","permalink":"/blog/tags/coffee"},{"inline":true,"label":"life","permalink":"/blog/tags/life"}],"readingTime":0.77,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Deng","title":"Magpie","url":"https://github.com/paulliwali","imageURL":"https://github.com/paulliwali.png","key":"pdeng","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"brew-logs-2019","title":"Brew Logs 2019","authors":"pdeng","tags":["coffee","life"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Brew Logs 2018","permalink":"/blog/brew-logs-2018"},"nextItem":{"title":"Brew Logs 2017","permalink":"/blog/brew-logs-2017"}},"content":"## February 2019\\n\\nIt has been a while since I\u2019ve had the time to try new beans.
