And note how each night\'s sleep correlated with how I felt.\\n\\n## Components\\n\\nIn terms of sleep length:\\n\\n* FitBit tracked an average of 6.8 hours for both weeks\\n* Whoop tracked that I slept for an average of 6.5 hours (with 8 hours in bed) in the first week and an average of 5.1 hours (6 hours in bed) for second week\\n\\nAnd for sleep quality:\\n\\n* FitBit tracked a score of 70 for both weeks\\n* Whoop tracked 71% and 52% performance\\n\\n## Issues\\n\\nWhy was there a huge discrepancy in the second week?\\nThis leads to the issue I had with Whoop, the sensors are less forgiving if its not worn properly.

The reason to have a second brain is to keep your primary brain\'s cognitive activity free of clutter and not be bogged down with remembering numbers, names, and details. It can be focused on the process of understanding and reasoning knowledge.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nBeing an avid podcast listener, I was also aware that a lot of information just goes in one ear and out the other. The stories, quotes, and ideas from the podcasts were very engaging in the moment and I felt that I was *never* going to forget it. But time and time again, I failed to recall all the details when I want to bring up the story in a conversation.\\n\\nI needed a way to store and access facts, so I can keep my brain free of clutter to focus on cognitive thinking.\\n\\nI was researching this one day and found a book called [\u201cHow to take Smart Notes\\"](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes) which describes the process of a slip-box system that was used by Niklas Luhmann to write more prolifically. This note-taking system is a way of organizing thoughts and intermingling ideas to inspire new ones. The emphasis of this system is on the web of connections made between each thought. Also, it encourages you to write small ready-made pieces each time and when you want to write a longer piece - you just have to connect the pieces. This way, the daunting task of writing a full-length piece is broken down into smaller efforts each day.\\n\\nThis method is also known as the Zettelkasten Method which is German for \\"slip-box\\", and the original implementation uses index cards. Even though I love nothing more than an analog system, it is probably way too much of a hassle to maintain and update. And, the pain of searching for something is probably not worth the novelty.\\n\\nSo I turned to software.\\n\\nI initially started with [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/). A decent program that is a markdown editor with bi-directional references and tagging. But I didn\'t get that \\"joy\\" factor when using it, it felt like a tool designed and intended for academic use.\\n\\n![zettlr](zettlr.webp)\\n\\nThen I discovered [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) which is an online app that had a strong community behind it. This web app made creating and linking notes extremely easy and the interface was clean to start using without much friction but provided lots of depth for customization. I got into customizing the look and feel of it and had several templates to make daily note entries, book reviews, article summaries, and TIL entries. But I started to feel that the system is doing a good job collecting everything I attempt to write down but doesn\'t give me a good way to re-organize. I started to feel like it was a messy drawer where I can easily dump notes but was difficult to see how many notes I had and find the right notes at the right time. The web of notes kept growing outwards and they were not strengthening in connection with each other - the promise of generating new ideas was not fulfilled.\\n\\n![roam-research](roam.webp)\\n\\nIn search of this filling of control, I decided to try [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). A full-fledged desktop app that looks like a glorified markdown editor, but has lots of small features that make untangling this mess of a web inside my second brain considerably easier.\\n\\n![obsidian](obsidian-promo.webp)\\n\\nThe first thing I did was export and import all my notes from Roam, and Obsidian has a very helpful markdown importer tool to automatically reformat the syntax from Roam to Obsidian. Then, I reorganize all my existing notes into the `slip-box` folder which is divided like so:\\n\\n```\\nslip-box/\\n\u251c\u2500 reference-notes/\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 highlights-from-article.md\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 highlights-from-blog.md\\n\u251c\u2500 literature-notes/\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 idea-1-explained-in-my-own-words.md\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 idea-2-explained-in-my-own-words.md\\n\u251c\u2500 permanent-notes/\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 2a-different-idea-explained.md\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 1a-explanation-of-idea.md\\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 1a1-tangent-from-1a.md\\n```\\n\\nMost of the notes I had got dumped into `reference-notes`. There was also a small tree of permanent notes growing that I had forgotten about! It was lost in the woods of Roam and I re-read those and moved them into [permanent-notes]. Then I installed some community plugins to automate my daily notes routine. I used [calendar], [dataview], and [templater] in conjunction with [daily notes] to automagically create a daily note with a habit tracker, journal section, ephemeral notes for brain dumping, and dynamic links to notes I created or touched during the day.\\n\\nWith all this in place, I am starting to feel at home in my second brain.\\n\\n![obsidian-personal](obsidian.webp)\\n\\n> Note: Obsidian v1.0.3 on Mac M1 has this long loading time when coming out of hibernation after not using the app for a while.

I was planning a move to San Francisco and right before I was starting to pack I came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8o8-EdZY0) where Matt D\u2019avella (kind of a modern-influencer minimalist) counted everything he owned. While I am by no means a minimalist, I do spend a lot of time debating whether I should purchase something or try my best to make things I already own to be as multifunctional as possible. For example, my longboard doubles up as my shoe-rack or just coffee mugs instead of different sizes and shapes for holding different types of liquids.\\n\\n![dogs-playing](dogs-playing.webp)\\n\\nmy dog playing with her friend, the only shot of my longboard shoe-rack\\n\\nOn top of multi-purposing, whenever I want to purchase anything new, I usually write it down on one of several shopping lists I have on my phone and evaluate the need for it by how frequently I try to re-add this item when an instance where I felt like my life would be much easier if I could use that item. Since I have kind of this reduction approach to buying material things, I thought it could also mean I don\u2019t own too many things - so it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to count everything up while I packed. Right?\\n\\nGround rules:\\n\\n* pair of things counted as one thing\\n* multi-paged documents counted as one thing (like how I would count a book)\\n* wires used for purposes other than power counted as separate things\\n* batteries where I have replacements of count as separate things\\n* consumables - food or products - didn\u2019t count.\\n\\nHere is the breakdown.\\n\\n![count-of-things](count-of-things.webp)\\n\\nSurprisingly, \u201cclothing\u201d was the largest category at nearly 30% with 153 items. I wasn\u2019t expecting this because I thought I kept quite a lean closet with just basic items that I wear everyday. Also add in the fact that it is sunny all-year around in California I trimmed out most of my wet/cold/hailing/snowing/depressing clothing from Canada.\\n\\nI was expecting kitchen to be in number one spot because I own a few too many coffee mugs and thought that there is just a minimum number of essential kitchen equipments you need if you are cooking at home regularly.\\n\\nHowever, these two categories are probably the least notable to someone who is trying to guesstimate how many things they might own. Because they are often organized away in shelves and take up little space compared to furniture, electronics and decor. While these items do take up more space, I only own a combined 81 items in these three categories. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of underestimating because those are the obvious large items you can easily count.\\n\\nWas this whole thing a waste of time? Well depends. I might do this every time I move so I can get a sense if I am getting bloated with more items or not. Even if I don\u2019t end up doing that it was still kind of interesting to see how many things you own and really consider how they add to your life."},{"id":"til2021","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/til2021","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-01-24-til2021/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-24-til2021/index.md","title":"Things I TIL\'ed in 2021","description":"I always lament the fact that I forgot all the random things I learned over the year, so in 2021 I made an effort to note down the things I learned just to make this post at the end of the year to look back and remember it again.","date":"2022-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 24, 2022","tags":[{"label":"til","permalink":"/blog/tags/til"}],"readingTime":14.555,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Deng","title":"Magpie","url":"https://github.com/paulliwali","imageURL":"https://github.com/paulliwali.png","key":"pdeng"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"til2021","title":"Things I TIL\'ed in 2021","authors":"pdeng","tags":["til"]},"prevItem":{"title":"How many things do I own?","permalink":"/blog/how-many-things"},"nextItem":{"title":"Brew Logs 2018","permalink":"/blog/brew-logs-2018"}},"content":"I always lament the fact that I forgot all the random things I learned over the year, so in 2021 I made an effort to note down the things I learned just to make this post at the end of the year to look back and remember it again.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nSo the first ever TIL annual review is for the year 2021, which might be remembered as the year where we thought COVID was over and the world will go back to being \u201cnormal\u201d but it pulled an uno reverse on us and now we are in lockdown ~~#4~~ #5 and booster ~~#2~~ #3.

The subtle honey and black leaf aromas were more prominent in the Perger method, whereas the acidity dominated the taste profile in the 40/60 method. Because of the interesting aromas with this particular bean, the Perger method is preferred.\\n\\n## May 2018\\n\\nAfter almost two weeks without proper coffee, I bought some beans from Sumatra, Indonesia to try. It was brewed in the Chemex with the usual ratio of 1:16.7, and the resulting brew had a slightly juicy body that gets sour the more sips you take. The first notes were definitely earthy and herbal - the card indicated tobacco as one of the notes - but obviously I can\u2019t start to tell the difference tobacco, cedar and wood. Then the subsequent notes are sharp, dry and acidic.\\n\\nNot sure if I enjoyed this one, it is not a combination I particularly enjoy. Which means I probably should write a mental note here - **DON\u2019T BUY SUMATRA INDONESIAN BEANS AGAIN!**\\n\\n## August 2018 (Pour over cold brew)\\n\\n* Beans: Kicking horse 454 horsepower\\n* Grind Size: 10\\n* Coffee Portion: 25g\\n* Water Portion: 200 ml\\n* Ice portion: 250 g\\n* Brew Time: ~2:00\\n* Taste: Strong, oily and bitter\\n* Rate: 7/10\\n\\nDuring the summertime, I prefer to cold brew my coffee. This year I learned about Japanese cold pour over - which is much faster to prepare compared to the traditional cold brew. Instead of brewing overnight, Japanese cold pour over uses ice to instantly cool the hot coffee to a refreshing temperature.\\n\\nTo make this, you start by heating the vessel and wet the filter paper with boiling water. Then you add about ~150g of ice into the vessel before making any coffee. Then you slowly pour about 200ml of water over finely grind coffee beans with the usual bloom and pour steps. As the final drips of water is filtered through, you add about ~100g of ice into the coffee to finish.\\n\\nAt the end you have a cup of nicely chilled coffee to start the summer day.\\n\\n## v60 Pour Methods\\nAbout 6 months ago, I got a Hario v60 dripper for my morning brews. Since I am the only coffee drinker in the house, making a single cup with the 6-cup Chemex seems awfully wasteful. With the smaller dripper, it allowed me to explore different pour methods and test their differences in my daily cup of coffee.\\n\\nI use the Baratza Encore on setting 21 to grind the beans for all of the pour methods.\\n\\n### The Perger Method\\n\\n* Coffee - 12g\\n* Water - 200ml\\n* Pour - 50ml bloom, 50ml @ 30s, 100ml @60s\\n\\nMatt Perger\'s technique is very simple and easy to replicate. It produces a softer cup with less accentuation to the sweetness and acidity of the beans. I usually make a cup with 27g of coffee while keeping the same coffee:water ratio. This method scales well with different amounts of coffee because dividing the water into three distinct pours allow control without being too finicky.\\n\\n### 4-6 Method\\n\\n* Coffee - 20g\\n* Water - 300ml\\n* Pour - 40% of water in two pours, 60% of water in as many pours as you want\\n\\nThis award winning technique by Tetsu Kasuya is nuanced and more difficult to perform. However, I love the precision this pour gives to the flavor of the final cup. The idea of this method is the 40% component determines the balance between acidity and sweetness. The more water one uses in the first pour of this component, the more acidic the final cup will be, and vice versa. The 60% component determines the strength of the coffee. If one divides the 60% of water with more number of pours, the stronger the coffee will be. Since this method also calls for a slightly higher coffee:water ratio, the resulting cup is more flavorful. I always chose to use this method with a fresh batch of beans to experience the palette for the first time.\\n\\n### Continuous Pour\\n\\n* Coffee - 27g\\n* Water - 450ml\\n* Pour - initial bloom, then pour the rest slowly in a circular pattern, aim for 2:00 - 2:30 brew time\\n\\nInstead of pouring water in distinct batches and waiting for each batch of water to completely dissipate through the grounds, this method continuously add water after the bloom step. Begin by pre-wetting the ground with 75g or so of water (depends on how much coffee there is). Actively dig through the grounds to ensure there are no dry spots and the gases are released from the freshly grind beans. Then pouring in slow and steady circles around the center of the v60, near but not on the edge of the grounds. Allow water to build up as high as possible without spilling. Rao spin can be achieved through this continuous pour. The Rao spin is a way to achieve a flatter bed to allow for even extraction (although not actually invented by Scott Rao). Another way to achieve a flatter bed is to carefully thump the v60 down on the cup and gravity should even out the grinds. Although this method doesn\'t allow for customization of the flavor, it is consistent in producing the same cup over and over again."},{"id":"brew-logs-2019","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/brew-logs-2019","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-05-23-brew-logs-2019.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-05-23-brew-logs-2019.md","title":"Brew Logs 2019","description":"February 2019","date":"2021-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 23, 2021","tags":[{"label":"coffee","permalink":"/blog/tags/coffee"},{"label":"life","permalink":"/blog/tags/life"}],"readingTime":0.765,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Deng","title":"Magpie","url":"https://github.com/paulliwali","imageURL":"https://github.com/paulliwali.png","key":"pdeng"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"brew-logs-2019","title":"Brew Logs 2019","authors":"pdeng","tags":["coffee","life"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Brew Logs 2018","permalink":"/blog/brew-logs-2018"},"nextItem":{"title":"Brew Logs 2017","permalink":"/blog/brew-logs-2017"}},"content":"## February 2019\\n\\nIt has been a while since I\u2019ve had the time to try new beans.
