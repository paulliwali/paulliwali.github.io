Russell in 1901 showed that every set theory that contains an unrestricted comprehension principle leads to contradictions<ul><li>Discovered independently by Ernst Zermelo in 1899</li></ul></li><li>Unrestricted comprehension principle is that for any sufficiently well-defined property, there is the set of all and only the objects that have that property</li><li>Explaining this paradox in layman&#x27;s term * I have two examples<ul><li>Barber paradox: a barber is &quot;one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves&quot; and the question is * does the barber shave themself?<ul><li>If the barber shaves themselves then by the definition above, he is no longer a barber</li><li>But if barber doesn&#x27;t shave themself then he belongs in the group of people that needs to be shaved by a barber which is themself</li></ul></li><li>The other is: all rules have exceptions<ul><li>If this is a rule, then there must be an exception where there are a set of rules without exceptions</li><li>However, if that were to be true then the original statement is false</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Punch card machines predates computers<ul><li>I have always associated punch cards with the old computers that took up an entire floor and thinking about handing in computer assignments that were in binder full of punch cards and accidentally feeding

plug</li><li>It is meant to suppress high frequency electronic noise in the circuit which prevents electromagnetic interference from and to the device</li></ul></li><li>Da Hong Pao Mother Trees<ul><li>The origin of Da Hong Pao (big red robe) tea is from a story where a scholar was on his way to take the imperial exam, the Gaokao of olden days, but was exhausted from the journey. A monk brewed some tea and he was able to continue his journey and ended up with the top score. On the way home, he paid tribute to the tree where the tea was from by putting his red robe from attaining the top score around it</li><li>There are 6 trees in the rocks of Jiu Long Ke in Wuyi, Fujian which have been around for 360 years</li><li>According to folklore, the teas from these trees were sent as tribute to the Emperor<ul><li>In 1998, 20g of tea produced from these trees were auctioned for 20,000 USD</li><li>It is no longer allowed to harvest from these trees as they are protected national heritage</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Hemingway Cats<ul><li>These are 6-toed cats (polydactyle) cats that live on Hemingway&#x27;s property<ul><li>They all carry the gene but half exhibit the physical trait</li></ul></li><li>Ernest Hemingway was given a 6-toed cat by a ship&#x27;s captain<ul><li>His residence on Key West is relatively isolated, so the descendents are kept relatively within the same gene pool</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Whale Falls<ul><li>The phenomenon where a large carcasses like a whale can fall onto the deep ocean floor intact</li><li>Discovered in 1987, by the submersible vessels that was used in the Titanic Salvage</li><li>These contain complex localized ecosystem for sea organisms for decades</li></ul></li><li>Duck Tape<ul><li>Originates from duck cloth (from the Dutch word doek) which was a heavy woven fabric that can be made waterproof by coating it with wax</li><li>Strips of these duck cloth were used as tape, so the correct spelling for this term is indeed duck and not duct</li></ul></li><li>Nerfing<ul><li>Gaming term that means to tune down the ability or the mechanic of a character</li><li>It is a reference to the Nerf guns being the soft version of the actual thing</li></ul></li><li>Bone Dry Martini<ul><li>Gin in a chilled glass, sometimes washed with vermouth just to be discarded before pouring in the gin</li></ul></li><li>Ergodicity<ul><li>Long one</li><li>An ergodic system is when the average outcome of a cohort is the <strong>same</strong> as the average outcome of the individual over time<ul><li>For example, if there are 100 gamblers in a casino and they making bets with the odds that 1/100 gamblers will go bankrupt. But this means that, if gambler number 28 goes bust, it has no effect on gambler number 29. Using the standard cost-benefit analysis * this activity would have a good expected average return</li><li>However, if this is applied to a single person across 100 days with the same odds. This person can go bust on day 28 and have no money for future days.</li><li>This means that the ensemble probability can&#x27;t be applied to the time probability of a single individual * not an ergodic system!</li></ul></li><li>Usually, financial decisions <em>assume</em> ergodic system when in reality it is <em>actually</em> non-ergodic<ul><li>For example, a commonly used financial planning tool for retirement assumes a constant rate of return in investment. However, if you layer in the actual sequence of rate of return that average out to the constant rate on top of actual expenses * you could potentially be in a situation where you run out of money sooner than expected</li></ul></li><li>Relating to the idea from Nassim Taleb&#x27;s book [<!-- -->[Antifragile]<!-- -->], there is an idea that some things respond negatively to volatility while others respond positively.<ul><li>Things that respond positively are antifragile and also ergodic</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Abilene Paradox<ul><li>When the group makes a decision in contrary to all the individuals&#x27; preferences</li><li>Stems from thinking that others in the group would prefer something even though they personally don&#x27;t</li></ul></li><li>PF Chang, Haagen-Dazs<ul><li>Marketing tactic to give the audience an expectation for the product</li><li>The PF in PF Chang stands for Paul Fleming one of the two co-founders, the other is Philip Chiang<ul><li>But when the initials are used as the restaurant name it gives a less obvious hint to the non asian roots</li></ul></li><li>Haagen-Dazs was invented by the creators to &quot;sound Danish&quot;<ul><li>A tribute to their good treatment of Jews during WWII</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.beginnerwineguide.com/what-is-the-story-behind-that-rooster-on-the-neck-of-the-wine-bottle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chianti Rooster Legend</a><ul><li>Area between Florence and Siena in Italy that was under contention</li><li>After decades of battles, they decided to settle it once and for all by having their knights race to the boundary at the sound of a rooster&#x27;s crow</li><li>They picked their own roosters and the Florentines picked a black rooster that they starved for days</li><li>It croaked much earlier than sunrise, and their knight raced to only 20KM away from the Sienna walls</li></ul></li><li>Why is the glacier water blue<ul><li>Due to the minerals from the glacier <em> glacier flour </em> absorbing the short wavelengths and the water still absorbing the long wavelengths</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.space.com/light-pollution-loss-dark-skies-noctalgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noctalgia</a><ul><li>Sky grief</li><li>A new term to describe the loss of the dark sky due to light pollution</li></ul></li><li>When pigs fly<ul><li>An adynaton, which is an hyperbole that is so extreme to imply the impossible</li><li>Other adynaton include:<ul><li>&quot;I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek&quot;</li><li>&quot;Not before Hell freezes over&quot;</li><li>&quot;When the Leafs win the Cup&quot; ;)</li></ul></li><li>There seems to be a trend of animal references (when cows fly, when hens grow teeth, when cow coughs, when a owl&#x27;s tail blooms, when donkeys fly, when fish climb poplar trees)</li></ul></li><li>Drunk bears in Montana<ol><li>There is a railroad near Glacier National Park where the trains sometimes spill grain and it gets fermented. The bears in the area would come an get drunk off the fermented grain and either try to outrun the train on the track or would be wasted on the track causing many deaths</li></ol><ul><li>No preventative action as been actively taken right now because the rail company believe that grizzly bears will be delisted<ul><li>Of the measures that were discussed the only one that seems reasonable is to not load the train in a way that would cause spillage</li><li>Which seems obvious enough since the grain seems to be lost on the road anyways</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Footgun<ul><li>A programming joke for a feature that results in the user shooting themself in the foot</li></ul></li><li>Schrodinger&#x27;s Cat<ul><li>The common usage of this reference today is that it is an explainer for quantum mechanics but in actuality it was a criticism of Copenhagen&#x27;s interpretation which included the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic</li><li>Erwin Schrodinger came up with this paradoxical example to illustrate the <em>absurdity</em> of the Copenhagen&#x27;s interpretation where the cat can be <em>simultaneously</em> alive and dead in the box that contains a radiation monitor which can release poison</li><li>The collapse of the states happens when one looks into the box but when exactly did the quantum superposition end?</li></ul></li><li>Why is the Napa Valley is a great place to grow grapes for wine<ul><li>Diuaral temperature range<ul><li>The big temperature swing from day to night allows for the grapes to ripen for longer on the vine as the low temperature pauses the growth of the grapes</li><li>This gives the grapes a &quot;long hang time&quot; to develop more flavour for wine</li><li>The temperature swing comes from the cooling effect from the Pacific Ocean</li><li>Winegrowers will use fans to move the hotter air above the ground down during very cold nights to prevent frost from forming</li></ul></li><li>Diversity of soil types<ul><li>As a result of geological activity 150 million years ago</li><li>It is also well-drained and deep</li></ul></li><li>Policy<ul><li>It has become the first agricultural reserve in the US in 1968 which has stringent protections of the land for wine growing only</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Roses at the end of vineyard rows<ul><li>There are several explanations but could be urban legends</li><li>Disease detection system<ul><li>Roses are more sensitive to disease or insect infestation and could serve as an early warning system for the health of the vineyard</li><li>But winegrowers have also said if there are insects on the roses there is probably not enough time to protect the grapes</li></ul></li><li>Turn signal for the horses or oxen<ul><li>Back when farm animals were used, roses were used to ensure they don&#x27;t cut across the rows and damage the grapes</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Madeira Wine<ul><li>Fortified wine made on the Portuguese Medeira Islands by oxidizing wine through heat and aging</li><li>This produces wine that can be stored for a long long time, for decades and even centuries<ul><li>The oldest known vintage is a 1715 Terrantez</li></ul></li><li>Solera process is a way to age liquids by fractional blending of older products with younger ones to increase the average age<ul><li>It means &quot;on the ground&quot; in Spanish because the fractional blending transfers from between barrels from the top to bottom</li></ul></li><li>The Medeira wine produced in Napa uses this process with a very old vintage that was stored and forgotten when the family hid their alcohol during the prohibition and pivoted to another business</li></ul></li><li>Kona Coffee<ul><li>Grown exclusively on Kona, Hawaii on the Big Island</li><li>First planted by Don Francisco de Paula Marin in 1817 and popularized by Samuel Ruggles in 1828<ul><li>Started to switch the local sugar plantation owners over to growing coffee</li><li>But destroyed by weather and pests in 1850s</li></ul></li><li>Hermann Widemann in 1892 planted a variety of Guatemalan bean, which is called Kona Typica today<ul><li>Then coffee prices crashed in 1899 which caused most of coffee growers to switch back to sugar again</li><li>Brought back into popularity during WWII and created another boom in the industry on Kona</li></ul></li><li>Micheal Norton sold cheap coffee under the name &quot;100% Kona Coffee&quot; during 1993 and 1996<ul><li>The coffee farmers of Kona formed the Kona Coffee Council to protect the quality and reputation of Kona Coffee</li></ul></li><li>Quality and standard for Kona Coffee<ul><li>Must be hand-picked</li><li>Grown on volcanic soil in the Kona region full of nitrates, phosphates, iron, and manganese</li><li>Harvested late in season to ensure ripeness</li><li>The western slopes of Big Island where Kona is located also provides the ideal environment for coffee growing as the plants get abundant sun but also protection from flooding and excess sun from the hills and clouds</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Pleonasm<ul><li>Redundancy in words<ul><li>Sometimes it is intentionally used to create emphasis but sometimes it is a result of incorporating foreign words either through trade, travel or colonialism</li></ul></li><li>Few we are all familiar with are &quot;Chai tea&quot;, &quot;Naan bread&quot; or &quot;Queso cheese&quot;</li><li>But there are a lot more examples<ul><li>Geography related<ul><li>The El Capitan -&gt; The &quot;the&quot; Capitan</li><li>Lake Tahoe -&gt;

It was brewed in the Chemex with the usual ratio of 1:16.7, and the resulting brew had a slightly juicy body that gets sour the more sips you take.

This year I learned about Japanese cold pour over - which is much faster to prepare compared to the traditional cold brew. Instead of brewing overnight, Japanese cold pour over uses ice to instantly cool the hot coffee to a refreshing temperature.</p><p>To make this, you start by heating the vessel and wet the filter paper with boiling water. Then you add about ~150g of ice into the vessel before making any coffee. Then you slowly pour about 200ml of water over finely grind coffee beans with the usual bloom and pour steps. As the final drips of water is filtered through, you add about ~100g of ice into the coffee to finish.</p><p>At the end you have a cup of nicely chilled coffee to start the summer day.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="v60-pour-methods">v60 Pour Methods<a class="hash-link" href="#v60-pour-methods" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>About 6 months ago, I got a Hario v60 dripper for my morning brews. Since I am the only coffee drinker in the house, making a single cup with the 6-cup Chemex seems awfully wasteful. With the smaller dripper, it allowed me to explore different pour methods and test their differences in my daily cup of coffee.</p><p>I use the Baratza Encore on setting 21 to grind the beans for all of the pour methods.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-perger-method">The Perger Method<a class="hash-link" href="#the-perger-method" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Coffee - 12g</li><li>Water - 200ml</li><li>Pour - 50ml bloom, 50ml @ 30s, 100ml @60s</li></ul><p>Matt Perger&#x27;s technique is very simple and easy to replicate. It produces a softer cup with less accentuation to the sweetness and acidity of the beans. I usually make a cup with 27g of coffee while keeping the same coffee:water ratio. This method scales well with different amounts of coffee because dividing the water into three distinct pours allow control without being too finicky.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-6-method">4-6 Method<a class="hash-link" href="#4-6-method" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Coffee - 20g</li><li>Water - 300ml</li><li>Pour - 40% of water in two pours, 60% of water in as many pours as you want</li></ul><p>This award winning technique by Tetsu Kasuya is nuanced and more difficult to perform. However, I love the precision this pour gives to the flavor of the final cup. The idea of this method is the 40% component determines the balance between acidity and sweetness. The more water one uses in the first pour of this component, the more acidic the final cup will be, and vice versa. The 60% component determines the strength of the coffee. If one divides the 60% of water with more number of pours, the stronger the coffee will be. Since this method also calls for a slightly higher coffee:water ratio, the resulting cup is more flavorful. I always chose to use this method with a fresh batch of beans to experience the palette for the first time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="continuous-pour">Continuous Pour<a class="hash-link" href="#continuous-pour" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Coffee - 27g</li><li>Water - 450ml</li><li>Pour - initial bloom, then pour the rest slowly in a circular pattern, aim for 2:00 - 2:30 brew time</li></ul><p>Instead of pouring water in distinct batches and waiting for each batch of water to completely dissipate through the grounds, this method continuously add water after the bloom step. Begin by pre-wetting the ground with 75g or so of water (depends on how much coffee there is). Actively dig through the grounds to ensure there are no dry spots and the gases are released from the freshly grind beans. Then pouring in slow and steady circles around the center of the v60, near but not on the edge of the grounds. Allow water to build up as high as possible without spilling. Rao spin can be achieved through this continuous pour. The Rao spin is a way to achieve a flatter bed to allow for even extraction (although not actually invented by Scott Rao). Another way to achieve a flatter bed is to carefully thump the v60 down on the cup and gravity should even out the grinds. Although this method doesn&#x27;t allow for customization of the flavor, it is consistent in producing the same cup over and over again.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/coffee">coffee</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/blog/brew-logs-2019">Brew Logs 2019</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2021-05-23T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">May 23, 2021</time> · <!-- -->One min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--6 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/paulliwali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo" src="https://github.com/paulliwali.png" alt="Paul Deng"></a><div class="avatar__intro" itemprop="author" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Person"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/paulliwali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" itemprop="url"><span itemprop="name">Paul Deng</span></a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle" itemprop="description">Magpie</small></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="february-2019">February 2019<a class="hash-link" href="#february-2019" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It has been a while since I’ve had the time to try new beans. Today I brewed two cups of Ethiopia Limu beans with the intent of testing two different grind settings. Usually, I grind at 21 on the Baratza Encore for pour-over because it was a number I found online and I never thought too much of it.</p><p>I figured the internet is never wrong, why bother checking it.</p><p>But that’s half the fun of brewing at home, you get to tinker with the little levers and dial into your favorite setup. So I brewed two cups with the ratio of 200 ml of water to 12.5 g of coffee, and the same pour method of 4 pours with a 60 ml bloom, 120 ml, 180 ml and 20 ml Rao Spin to finish. The Rao Spin gives you an even bed of grounds to end the extraction process.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/coffee">coffee</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/life">life</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/2"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older Entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Tutorial</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Stack Overflow<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 My Project, Inc.
