year, so in 2021 I made an effort to note down the things I learned just to make this post at the end of the year to look back and remember it again.</p>
<p>So the first ever TIL annual review is for the year 2021, which might be remembered as the year where we thought COVID was over and the world will go back to being ânormalâ but it pulled an uno reverse on us and now we are in lockdown <del>#4</del> #5 and booster <del>#2</del> #3. Thoughâ¦ the bigger problem might be the growing distrust between the public and neutral organizations that is suppose to provide scientific recommendations. Whoa this got heavy real quick but it is also kinda how every normal conversation seems to nose-dive to these days.</p>

<p>This rabbit hole lead to a few more linguistic TILs.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loanword</a>
A word that is left untranslated from another language and permanently adopted as is. Some great examples I found are: tofu (Chinese - duofu), cafe (French - cafÃ©), kindergarten (German - kinder[child]garten[garden]), calque (French - calque), deja vu (French - dÃ©jÃ  vu).</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a <a href="https://wold.clld.org/vocabulary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole database</a> of loaned words and English, which does not surprise me, is one of top languages with borrowed words but it is also the most loaned word language to other languages. While Mandarin has the least loaned words from other languages.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calque" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calque</a>
A word or phrase that is translated literally word-for-word from another language. For example, âskyscraperâ is a calque in many other languages and âflea marketâ is a calque from French term marchÃ© aux puces (market of fleas).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verbund (n.)
German word that means âthe physical integration of productsâ, when the by-product of the assembly for one product can be used in another assembly line. This is the metaphor used for note-taking techniques that allows ideas and knowledge to mix together to create new thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active Inhibition (n.)
Actively build a mind filter between free-flowing thoughts and long-term memory, this helps with avoiding being flooded with memories when consciously problem solving. This is one of the goals of note-taking!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kakorrhaphiophobia (n.)
The fear of failure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A tangential fear is the fear of long words and the people who named it were sick deviants because it is one of the longest words in the English dictionary - <strong>Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia</strong>.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>Zeigarnik Effect (n.)
The tolling effect that open tasks can have on our minds, it is why writing a to-do list can help declutter our mind because it tricks our mind that it is closed. However, this can be leveraged for difficult problems by keeping them âopenâ in our mind and letting our conscious/unconscious self to ruminate over it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitz_Roy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fitz Traverse</a> or Fitz Roy
A skyline in Patagonia, Argentina that was first traversed by Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold in February 2014. They were assisted by another group that started at the same time (Rolando Garibotti and Colin Haley) but they stopped halfway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/brief-history-peanut-butter-180976525/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peanut Butter</a>
Originally invented by the Incas, but re-popularized by John Harvey Kellogg, he made this compound for patients at the Battle Creek Sanitarium as it is easily digestible. Kellogg promoted plant-based diet over meat and with his clientele of Amelia Earhart, Sojourner Truth and Henry Ford helped establish peanut butter as a delicacy. During WWI, there was meat rationing so Americans substituted meat with peanut butter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>

<ol start="11">
<li>Earth is Spinning Faster
July 19, 2020 marked the shortest day ever recorded which was 1.4603 ms shorter than the standard day. With the development of atomic clocks, scientists have been observing that Earth has been speeding up slowly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Usually we add leap second after a few years to compensate for the slowing effects, but we may need to add a <em>negative leap second</em> and can have unintended consequences on technology that depends on &quot;true time&quot;.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Stanning (v.)
Added to the Oxford dictionary in 2018, to mean an overzealous or obsessive fan. Inspired by Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;Stan&quot;, released in 2000.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is crazy to me that the original song didnât elevate the word back then but it is the k-pop culture that adopted this word and caused it to be added to the dictionary.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Sonder (n.)
Just an amazing word, it describes the realization that everyone you pass by is living a life as vivid, memorable and important as your own.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The realization that each random passerby is living as life as vivid and complex as your own - populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness - an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you &#x27;ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.&quot; - The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="14">
<li>Temporal Illusion
An illusion that plays on our perception of time.</li>
</ol>
<p>We experience time in two ways, <em>prospectively</em> - actively through the passage of time, and <em>retrospectively</em> - recalling the passage of time.</p>
<p>One illusion we experience with empty or full events (boring or exciting events) is that the empty events feel long prospectively but short retrospectively while the full events feel short prospectively but long retrospectively.</p>
<p>This leads to the TV illusion which is a prominent experience of modern life, where you feel time passes by while you are experiencing it and when you recall upon it.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Oleka
The realization that only a few days are memorable.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>âOur lives are built of the same few notes, repeated over and over. It&#x27;s not a grand symphony, full of surprises. It&#x27;s a song sung in canon, that simply carries on, until the tune gets stuck in your head. But then the verse changes over, and for the life of you, you can&#x27;t remember how it&#x27;s suppose to go&quot; - The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="16">
<li>No Free Lunch Theorem
David Wolpert in a famous paper (1996) showed that if you make no assumptions about the data, there is no reason to choose one model over another. There is no way to know ahead of time that one model will work better than another.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, to practically build models you have to make some assumptions.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Euthymia (n.)
It describes the state when you believe in yourself and trust that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad of footpaths of those wandering in every direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pati (n.)
To suffer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin root of the English word passion.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Scopophobia (n.)
Fear of being seen or the center of attention. What drives our fear of public speaking so much, which is said to be most people&#x27;s biggest fear - even over death!</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There are two types of public speakers, those who are scared and those who are liars&quot; - Mark Twain (probably)</p>

<ol start="21">
<li>Tulip Mania
A term that refers to any economic bubble when the price of the item is inflated beyond its own &quot;intrinsic&quot; value</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally regarded as the first speculative bubble, as the price for tulip bulb drastically increased during the Dutch Golden Age (1581 - 1672) and crashed in 1637 February</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>
<p>Xenia (n.)
Greek word for their rule of showing generosity and hospitality to guests who are far from home. It translates to âguest-friendshipâ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Halting Problem
A problem in computing theory that asks if you were given the description of an arbitrary program and input, can you determine if the program will finish running or run forever</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Alan Turing in 1936 proved that a general algorithm to solve this problem for all program-input pairs is not possible. This proof is contingent on the mathematical definition of a computer and program.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Telic and Atelic
Telic comes from the Greek work Telos, which means &quot;having an inherent purpose&quot;</li>

<li>Bank Effect
When a ship passes close to a bank, the water between the ship and bank speeds up. When the speed increases, the pressure drops, which causes the stern to be pulled into the bank and bow to be pushed away from the bank. The more water the ship displaces or the closer to the bank, the stronger this effect.</li>

<li>Hyperobjects
Coined by philosopher Timothy Morton, something that is so massively distributed in space, but so sticky that it adheres to everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any civilization that progresses on reason will create such objects, but the fact that we have not observed any could mean there is a &quot;Great Filter&quot; that the hyperobject creates which destroys the civilization.</p>
<p>An hyperobject we are creating could be the climate effects and if we don&#x27;t solve it we will be casted out by this great filter.</p>
