Gatekeeping is childish and it's a sign that people are insecure about their interests.

What is this counter-gatekeeping about then?

<!--truncate-->

It's that kid in high-school skipping through the grades and graduating early. Like what is the rush?

Still not clear? Yeah, my bad - let’s give an example.

Say if you develop a new hobby in home coffee brewing it might look something like this:

1. Informer - someone who learned there is a whole world beyond drip coffee

2. Dabbler - someone who is starting to know the difference between pour-over and immersion brew and probably owns a home setup to brew their daily cups of coffee

3. Gatekeeper (optional) -  someone who looks down on those that drink venti cold brew with half a cup of oat milk and a few packets of stevia

4. Lifer - someone who appreciates the intricacies of coffee making but doesn’t try to convert everyone from their dog to their grandma into becoming a home barista

 I started to notice that I like to rush through this progression whenever I find a new hobby or a lane of interest.

Why?

Is it because I am scared of being labeled as a gatekeeper and I want to immediately jump past it?

It is because I think informer and dabbler are not worthwhile?

I think I should take more time to enjoy each step of the process and be okay with enjoying the "lesser" versions of that thing.
