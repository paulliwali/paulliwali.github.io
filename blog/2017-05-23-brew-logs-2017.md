Note: New coffee specialty shop opened on Bay and Wellesley, they do all kinds of brews from Turkish to Siphon. I tried two kinds of beans, the one from Brazil is the clear favourite with a more balanced and rich body over the one from El Salvador which is fruitier and sharper. Also trying a new brewing method from Tetsu Kasuya - 40/60 method which is a way to manually control the sweet and sour balance and strength level independently.

## January 2017

* Beans: Kicking horse beans
* Grind Size: 21
* Coffee Portion: 27 g
* Water Portion: 450 ml
* Brew Time: 2:25
* Color: Deep dark black
* Taste: Sharp and acidic
* Rate: 7/10

Note: Upgraded the dinky hand grinder with the Baratza electrical burr grinder. The consistency with the grounds this electrical grinder produces is so much more superior to the hand grinder. It is well worth the $120 investment. The coffee beans are not my favourite, I bought it mostly because it came in a nice anniversary tin. So I can use it to store coffee in the future.
