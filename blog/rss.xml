            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best and most indirect way to journal and review the year</p>
<p>2023's collection of TILs may appear somewhat eclectic, but isn't each year a tapestry woven with threads of serendipity? This compilation might be a bit shorter, with some more profound insights than the usual bite-sized TILs, but I hope you'll find it an enjoyable read.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Scare quotes</p>
<ul>
<li>Quotation marks put around a term or sentence when it is not required to spread doubt</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Some examples that come to my mind are "global warming", "pandemic", "bug"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bit Rot</p>
<ul>
<li>When code is not actively maintained, also known as software rot</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A similar concept for data engineering exists and I think a good name for it would be data rot</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Where people forget what specific fields mean or problems that are embedded in the data</li>
<li>Stems from embedding custom or business logic into the extract-transform-load pipeline for the sake of easier queries for the end-users</li>
<li>This behavior can quickly degrade into long-term maintainability and usability issues and cause data rot</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Doumbek</p>
<ul>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/Goblet_drum_01.jpg" alt="" class="img_ev3q"></li>
<li>Egyptian drum, a mesmerizing percussion instrument producing "Doom," "Tak," and "Pa" sounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chrono-urbanism</p>
<ul>
<li>A way of planning the city around <em>time</em> instead of <em>space</em></li>
<li>The Northstar for chrono-urbanism city planning would be the "<a href="https://www.15minutecity.com/blog/hello" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15-minute city</a>" where access to essential needs of a person are met within 15 minutes<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A secondary goal would be to meet this not just physically but also financially</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seattle is exploring this concept in their <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/ongoing-initiatives/seattle-2035-comprehensive-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20-year vision plan</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell's Paradox</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bertrand Russell in 1901 showed that every set theory that contains an unrestricted comprehension principle leads to contradictions</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovered independently by Ernst Zermelo in 1899</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unrestricted comprehension principle is that for any sufficiently well-defined property, there is the set of all and only the objects that have that property</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>So that was probably very confusing, tbh that was a lot of copying and pasting, so trying to explain this paradox in layman's terms, I have two examples</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Barber paradox: a barber is "one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves" and the question is: does the barber shave themself?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If the barber shaves themselves then by the definition above, he is no longer a barber</li>
<li>But if a barber doesn't shave themself then he belongs in the group of people that needs to be shaved by a barber which is themself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The other is: that all rules have exceptions<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If this is a rule, then there must be an exception where there is a set of rules without exceptions</li>
<li>However, if that were to be true then the original statement would be false</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Punch card machines predate computers</p>
<ul>
<li>Used in the late 18th and early 19th century for looms to weave different patterns on clothes and it was later used by IBM in the 1890s to program code</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I have always associated punch cards with the old computers that took up an entire floor and thinking about handing in computer assignments that were in a binder full of punch cards and accidentally feeding them in the wrong order and having the program crash</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://asnewman.github.io/shoshikantetsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shoshikantetsu</a></p>
<ul>
<li>To carry out something as intended when you have low motivation</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I need to remember this in the latter half of the year when most of the New Year resolutions are going by the wayside!</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stroad</p>
<ul>
<li>A portmanteau (an old TIL) of street and road</li>
<li>Coined by the American civil engineer Charles Marohn to describe poorly designed infrastructure that fails to do the job of either a street or road so it ends up doing both poorly</li>
<li>A street is meant to be a destination in itself with shops and restaurants to promote pedestrian use</li>
<li>A road is meant to transport people from point A to B</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally my favourite TIL of the year!</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cunningham's Law</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The internet's ironic wisdom: To find the right answer, post the wrong one</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The obligatory xkcd reference. Not sure who Cunningham is or if it's a reference to something.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ferrite bead</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember those bulgy plastic before the plug that looks like this <img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Cable_end.JPG/220px-Cable_end.JPG" alt="" class="img_ev3q"></li>
<li>It is meant to suppress high-frequency electronic noise in the circuit which prevents electromagnetic interference from and to the device</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Da Hong Pao Mother Trees</p>
<ul>
<li><img loading="lazy" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/bd777d_51bff6f886f341c08b2f1ca325c72ebd~mv2.jpg" alt="" class="img_ev3q"></li>
<li>The origin of Da Hong Pao (big red robe) tea is from a story where a scholar was on his way to take the imperial exam, the Gaokao of olden days, but was exhausted from the journey. A monk brewed some tea and he was able to continue his journey and ended up with the top score. On the way home, he paid tribute to the tree where the tea was from by putting his red robe from attaining the top score around it</li>
<li>There are 6 trees in the rocks of Jiu Long Ke in Wuyi, Fujian which have been around for 360 years</li>
<li>According to folklore, the teas from these trees were sent as tribute to the Emperor<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>In 1998, 20g of tea produced from these trees was auctioned for 20,000 USD</li>
<li>It is no longer allowed to harvest from these trees as they are protected national heritage</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hemingway Cats</p>
<ul>
<li>6-toed cats (polydactyl) cats that live on Hemingway's property<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>They all carry the gene but half exhibit the physical trait</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ernest Hemingway was given a 6-toed cat by a ship's captain</li>
<li>His residence in Key West is relatively isolated, so the descendants are kept relatively within the same gene pool</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whale Falls</p>
<ul>
<li>The phenomenon where a large whale carcass falls into the deep ocean floor relatively intact<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The carcass can house a complex localized ecosystem for sea organisms for decades</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>First discovered in 1987, by the submersible vessels that were used in the Titanic Salvage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duck Tape</p>
<ul>
<li>It originates from duck cloth (from the Dutch word doek) which is a heavy woven fabric that can be made waterproof by coating it with wax</li>
<li>Strips of these duck cloth were used as decoration or to strengthen shoes</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Settling the age-old debate: it's "duck" tape not "duct" tape</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nerfing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always knew that it was a gaming term that means to tune down the ability or the mechanic of a character, opposite of buffing</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Learned that it is a reference to the Nerf guns being the soft version of the actual thing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bone Dry Martini</p>
<ul>
<li>Gin in a chilled glass, sometimes washed with vermouth just to be discarded before pouring in the gin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ergodicity</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is gonna be a long one but super worthwhile</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An ergodic system is when the average outcome of a cohort is the <strong>same</strong> as the average outcome of the individual over time<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>For example, if there are 100 gamblers in a casino and they make bets with the odd 1/100 gamblers will go bankrupt. But this means that, if gambler number 28 goes bust, it does not affect gambler number 29. Using the standard cost-benefit analysis * this activity would have a good expected average return</li>
<li>However, if this is applied to a single person across 100 days with the same odds. This person can go bust on day 28 and have no money for future days.</li>
<li>This means that the ensemble probability can't be applied to the time probability of a single individual * not an ergodic system!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usually, financial decisions <em>assume</em> an ergodic system when in reality it is <em>actually</em> non-ergodic<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>For example, for retirement planning we often assume a constant rate of return on investment. However, if you layer in the actual sequence of the rate of return that averages out to the constant rate on top of your anticipated expenses - you could potentially be in a situation where you have to take out investments when it is not favorable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relating to the idea from Nassim Taleb's book Antifragile, there is an idea that some things respond negatively to volatility while others respond positively<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Things that respond positively are antifragile and also ergodic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abilene Paradox</p>
<ul>
<li>When the group makes a decision contrary to all the individuals' preferences</li>
<li>Stems from thinking that others in the group would prefer something even though they personally don't</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you've experienced this as a couple where you end up making a decision that you mistakenly thought the other person wanted</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>PF Chang, Haagen-Dazs</p>
<ul>
<li>Examples of a marketing tactic to give the audience an expectation for the product</li>
<li>The PF in PF Chang stands for Paul Fleming one of the two co-founders, the other is Philip Chiang</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>But when the initials are used as the restaurant name it was able to hide the non-Asian roots, kind of similar to JK Rowling hiding her gender by abbreviating her name because of the gender discrimination that was in the publishing world</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Haagen-Dazs was invented by the creators to "sound Danish"<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A tribute to their good treatment of Jews during WWII</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.beginnerwineguide.com/what-is-the-story-behind-that-rooster-on-the-neck-of-the-wine-bottle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chianti Rooster Legend</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The area between Florence and Siena in Italy was under contention and after decades of battles, they decided to settle it once and for all</li>
<li>Decided to settle it with their knights race to the boundary at the sound of a rooster's crow in the mornings</li>
<li>They were able to choose their own roosters and the Florentines picked a black rooster that they starved for days</li>
<li>Because of the starvation, it croaked way before sunrise, and the Florentine knight raced to only 20KM away from the Sienna walls</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes I know it's just folklore but also hilarious to think the Siennians (?) were just like, okay we accept you won that fair and square</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the glacier water blue</p>
<ul>
<li>Minerals from glaciers, known as glacier flour, absorb short wavelengths, giving glacier water its striking blue hue</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>for reference: ROYGBIV</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.space.com/light-pollution-loss-dark-skies-noctalgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noctalgia</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Means sky grief</li>
<li>A new term to describe the loss of the dark sky due to light pollution</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of the words from the dictionary obscure sorrows</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>When pigs fly</p>
<ul>
<li>An adynaton, which is a hyperbole that is so extreme to imply the impossible</li>
<li>Other adynatons include:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>"I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek"</li>
<li>"Not before Hell freezes over"</li>
<li>"When the Leafs win the Cup" ;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There seems to be a trend of animal references (when cows fly, when hens grow teeth, when cow coughs, when an owl's tail blooms, when donkeys fly, when fish climb poplar trees)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drunk bears in Montana</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a railroad near Glacier National Park where the trains will sometimes spill grain and it gets fermented from the sun. The bears in the area would come and get drunk off the fermented grain and either tries to outrun the train on the track or would be wasted on the track which leads to their deaths</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>No preventative action has been actively taken right now because the rail company believes that grizzly bears will be delisted as a threatened species</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Of the measures that were discussed the only one that seems reasonable is to not load the train in a way that would cause spillage. This seems obvious enough since the grain seems to be lost on the road anyway</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Footgun</p>
<ul>
<li>A programming joke for a feature that results in the user shooting themself in the foot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schrodinger's Cat</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The common usage of this reference today is that it is an explainer for quantum mechanics but in actuality, it was a criticism of Copenhagen's interpretation which included the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Erwin Schrodinger came up with this paradoxical example to illustrate the <em>absurdity</em> of Copenhagen's interpretation where the cat can be <em>simultaneously</em> alive and dead in the box that contains a radiation monitor that can release poison</li>
<li>The collapse of the states happens when one looks into the box but when exactly did the quantum superposition end?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the Napa Valley a great place to grow grapes for wine</p>
<ul>
<li>Diuaral temperature range<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The big temperature swing from day to night allows for the grapes to ripen for longer on the vine as the low temperature pauses the growth of the grapes</li>
<li>This gives the grapes a "long hang time" to develop more flavor for wine</li>
<li>The temperature swing comes from the cooling effect of the Pacific Ocean</li>
<li>Winegrowers will use fans to move the hotter air above the ground down during very cold nights to prevent frost from forming</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Diversity of soil types<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>As a result of geological activity 150 million years ago</li>
<li>It is also well-drained and deep</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Policy<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>It became the first agricultural reserve in the US in 1968 which has stringent protections of the land for wine growing only</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are there roses at the end of vineyard rows</p>
<ul>
<li>There are several explanations but could all be urban legends</li>
<li>Disease detection system<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Roses are more sensitive to disease or insect infestation and could serve as an early warning system for the health of the vineyard</li>
<li>But winegrowers have also said if there are insects on the roses there is probably not enough time to protect the grapes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Turn signal for the horses or oxen<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Back when farm animals were used, roses were used to ensure they didn't cut across the rows and damage the grapes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Madeira Wine</p>
<ul>
<li>Fortified wine made on the Portuguese Madeira Islands by oxidizing wine through heat and aging</li>
<li>This produces wine that can be stored for a long long time, for decades and even centuries<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The oldest known vintage is a 1715 Terrantez</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Solera process is a way to age liquids by fractional blending of older products with younger ones to increase the average age<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>It means "on the ground" in Spanish because the fractional blending transfers from between barrels from the top to bottom</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The Madeira wine produced in Napa uses this process with a very old vintage that was stored and forgotten when the family hid their alcohol during the prohibition and pivoted to another business</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kona Coffee</p>
<ul>
<li>Grown exclusively in Kona, Hawaii on the Big Island</li>
<li>First planted by Don Francisco de Paula Marin in 1817 and popularized by Samuel Ruggles in 1828<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Started to switch the local sugar plantation owners over to growing coffee</li>
<li>But destroyed by weather and pests in the 1850s</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hermann Widemann in 1892 planted a variety of Guatemalan bean, which is called Kona Typica today<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Then coffee prices crashed in 1899 which caused most coffee growers to switch back to sugar again</li>
<li>Brought back into popularity during WWII and created another boom in the industry on Kona</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Micheal Norton sold cheap coffee under the name "100% Kona Coffee" during 1993 and 1996<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The coffee farmers of Kona formed the Kona Coffee Council to protect the quality and reputation of Kona Coffee</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quality and standard to be Kona Coffee<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Must be hand-picked</li>
<li>Grown on volcanic soil in the Kona region full of nitrates, phosphates, iron, and manganese</li>
<li>Harvested late in the season to ensure ripeness</li>
<li>The western slopes of Big Island where Kona is located also provide the ideal environment for coffee growing as the plants get abundant sun but also protection from flooding and excess sun from the hills and clouds</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pleonasm</p>
<ul>
<li>Redundancy in words<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sometimes it is intentionally used to create emphasis but sometimes it is a result of incorporating foreign words either through trade, travel, or colonialism</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A few we are all familiar with are "Chai tea", "Naan bread" or "Queso cheese"</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>But there are a lot more examples<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Geography related<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The El Capitan -&gt; The "the" Capitan</li>
<li>Lake Tahoe -&gt; Lake <strong>Da ow</strong> a ga -&gt; Lake "edge of the lake"</li>
<li>Lake Michigan -&gt; Lake Michigama -&gt; Lake "large lake"</li>
<li>Mississippi River -&gt; Misi-sipi River -&gt; "Big river" River</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sports related<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The Los Angeles Angels -&gt; The "the" "angels" Angels</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acronym related<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>PIN number</li>
<li>Please RSVP</li>
<li>SI System</li>
<li>RAM memory</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A* algorithm</p>
<ul>
<li>A weighted Dijkstra's algorithm that makes it much more efficient</li>
<li>The weighting can be thought of as changing the height or potential of the nodes based on the distance to the destination and results in changing the bidirectional edge's length</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Island Gigantism</p>
<ul>
<li>The curious phenomenon of island-dwelling animals growing larger than their mainland counterparts.</li>
<li>Potentially caused by the lack of predators which a smaller body is needed for survival</li>
<li>Or potentially the larger body is needed to survive the scarce resources on the island or the harsher environments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effective Altruism</p>
<ul>
<li>Started as a movement in Oxford that aims to maximize the good as much as possible</li>
<li>This could mean taking actions that can lead to gaining the ability to enable someone/something to do more good than doing the good themselves because it's ineffective<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>An extreme example would be prioritizing the actions that lead to great amounts of wealth so that you can donate to organizations that are doing good instead of joining the organization to do good</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The recent poster boy of this movement was Sam Bankman-Fried. So that wasn't a good look</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six nines in pi</p>
<ul>
<li>A famous coincidence that at the 762nd decimal place of pi, there are 6 nines</li>
<li>Sometimes called "Feynman point" but it is not clear when Feynman made this reference</li>
<li>The position of the first 9 repeated nines is at 564,665,206</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diehard tests</p>
<ul>
<li>A battery of statistical tests for the randomness quality of a random number generator</li>
<li>Side note: true randomness is unintuitive to us because we are sensitive to patterns<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>We would see repeated numbers as patterns and assume true "randomness" should give us new and yet-to-be-seen numbers</li>
<li>But if we used common sense and imagine there is a fair six-sided dice, after a number has appeared the probability that the next roll will be a new one would not change, especially not increased</li>
<li>A common user expectation for Spotify shuffle or random photo function is to not have repeated results but in reality, the true random behavior would be for the results to be repeated more often as more of the results are discovered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Developed by George Marsaglia in 1995 and extended to the dieharder tests</li>
<li>Some interesting things<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Birthday spacings: the spacing between the points should be asymptotically exponentially distributed * based on the birthday paradox</li>
<li>Monkey tests: treat a sequence of some number of bits as "words", and the number of "words" that do not appear should follow a known distribution * based on the infinite monkey theorem</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wiki</p>
<ul>
<li>Hawaiian word for "quick"</li>
<li>The free shuttle bus at the Honolulu Airport is named Wiki Wiki Shuttle, which is an example of repeating a word for emphasis known as epizeuxis or palilogia</li>
<li>The first wiki, user-editable website was named WikiWikiWeb as the creator Ward Cunningham originally intended to name it QuickWeb</li>
<li>Wikipedia is a portmanteau of wiki and encyclopedia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gaslight</p>
<ul>
<li>A popular slang that means someone is psychologically manipulating you to cause you to question your memories and perception of reality</li>
<li>An example would be someone blatantly lying about a shared experience that contradicts the memories of the victim to convince them that the victim is crazy or overreacting</li>
<li>This colloquialism is derived from a 1944 film with the same title where the female protagonist's new husband is dimming gaslights in secret to drive her mad</li>

<p>When I mention that I am looking into how to sleep better, my friends and family first instinct is always "oh are you having trouble sleeping?"
It is not that I have trouble sleeping, it is just that I want to optimize sleep to the absolute maximum.
The importance of good quality sleep is increasingly being understood as the <strong>single most important factor to health</strong>.
Wouldn't I want this to be optimized better than my monster-hunter charge blade build?</p>
<p>The focus of this monitoring is to see which device correlate with my personal experience better so I can start to trust its outputs.</p>
<p>I will wear both devices on each of my wrists and flip halfway through after a week. And note how each night's sleep correlated with how I felt.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="components">Components<a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/blog/fitbit-vs-whoop#components" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Components" title="Direct link to Components">​</a></h2>
<p>In terms of sleep length:</p>
<ul>
<li>FitBit tracked an average of 6.8 hours for both weeks</li>
<li>Whoop tracked that I slept for an average of 6.5 hours (with 8 hours in bed) in the first week and an average of 5.1 hours (6 hours in bed) for second week</li>
</ul>
<p>And for sleep quality:</p>
<ul>
<li>FitBit tracked a score of 70 for both weeks</li>
<li>Whoop tracked 71% and 52% performance</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="issues">Issues<a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/blog/fitbit-vs-whoop#issues" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Issues" title="Direct link to Issues">​</a></h2>
<p>Why was there a huge discrepancy in the second week?
This leads to the issue I had with Whoop, the sensors are less forgiving if its not worn properly. Some examples of this are:</p>
<p>&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="fitbit_20221223-095343.webp"  alt="1" width ="360" height ="640"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="whoop_20221223-095331.webp" alt="2" width ="360" height ="640"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;where we see huge differences!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="fitbit_20221220-174041.webp"  alt="1" width ="360" height ="640"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="whoop_20221220-174026.webp" alt="2" width ="360" height ="640"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;And cases where we see that even if the total hours is close.
&lt;br&gt; The allocation of the sleep stages is mismatched.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="fitbit_20221214-061811.webp"  alt="1" width ="360" height ="640"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="whoop_20221214-062857.webp" alt="2" width ="360" height ="640"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are times where it matched up well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</p>
<p>But the problem is that it is very inconsistent.
And beyond this, I don't fully feel correlated with the results tracked by either devices.
More often than not, I feel well rested and did not wake up in the middle of the night as opposed to what the results show me - that I slept very lightly and woke several times.
Although FitBit is more consistent in measuring my sleep, it seems to under-estimate the hours and quality.</p>
<p>From what I have read and learned by speaking to friends in the wearable tech.
The basic hardware technology is identical across the different wearables, and what makes the differences is the algorithm used to determine sleep based on the signals the hardware is sending.
Depending on how the algorithm is tuned, the resulting analysis can vary from device to device.
Maybe Google trained their algorithm on someone who has a lower heart rate or less movement...but it doesn't test well on me.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="outcome">Outcome<a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/blog/fitbit-vs-whoop#outcome" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Outcome" title="Direct link to Outcome">​</a></h2>
<p>I will definitely not be switching to Whoop, since it is more expensive and less consistent in tracking sleep for me.
A side note, the strain calculation is pretty spot on, but I never recover enough for it.
Even though, FitBit underestimates my total sleep, I think it does a good job on being consistent in its analysis and I can just do manual adjustments from the baseline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another year, another TIL. This time I got 55 things.</p>
<p>This is a tradition I started last year to help me recall all the interesting tidbits I come across while surfing the web (why don't people say this anymore?) or listening to podcasts or talking to strangers at parties (sans COVID restrictions).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jevon's Paradox</a></p>
<ul>
<li>When something is invented to improve efficiency, our logic tells us that it should lead to a reduction in the inputs. But this paradox describes the increased efficiency in using a resource <em>can actually</em> lead to the higher usage of said resource and the combined effect is faster depletion of the resource</li>
<li>This was observed by economist William Jevons when he noted that the consumption of coal increased after the invention of the Watt steam engine</li>
<li>This could be caused by the fact that increased efficiency leads to a decrease in price which can increase demand if the commodity follows an elastic demand curve</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flocked Christmas Trees (n.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Christmas trees with fake snow.</li>
<li>Flocking is the process of creating texture by attaching tiny fibers to a material. This has been done since the 1800s when they used cotton and flour mixed with glue to create the snowy effect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Barista FIRE vs Coast FIRE</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="wealth spectrum" src="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/assets/images/wealth-spectrum-05aaea9560b5adb3b34912e9d4ed5ae0.webp" width="1200" height="450" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ul>
<li>Two interesting FIRE types that essentially mean you need to have a "barista" (or equivalent) job or "coast" at your job to support the somewhat financially independent lifestyle. So it is in a grey area before completely financially free</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.ithkuil.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ithkuil</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Known as the most difficult language to learn because it is a constructed language that is a cross between an <strong>a priori philosophical language</strong> and <strong>a logical language</strong></li>
<li>A priori language means that is not based on any existing languages</li>
<li>Philosophical language is designed to reflect some aspect of philosophy</li>
<li>Logic language enforces unambiguous statements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gluggaveður (n.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Icelandic word that means "window-weather", the type of weather that is best observed from the cozy and comfort of one's home</li>
<li>This warm word describes every fall raining playlist on Spotify but also a kind of mentality to bring when dealing with difficult emotions - try to observe it like you are wrapped up in a soft blanket with a hot tea</li>
<li>I wish there is a word like this but for "sweater-weather", the type of weather that is best observed sitting on a bench with a cup of hot coffee</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/356/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nerd Snipping</a></p>
<ul>
<li>A complex problem that will get the attention of academic or highly technical people regardless if it adds any value</li>
<li>Crypto-anything and Web3 might fall under this category since the touted advantages are not yet practical or demonstrated and the cost and inefficiencies of the architecture are impractical to build anything useful. It <strong>currently</strong> serves as a way to hype cryptocurrency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lede (n.)</p>
<ul>
<li>The opening section of a reporting meant to capture the attention of the audience</li>
<li>The intentional misspelling was meant to distinguish it from newspaper editors</li>
<li>It was added to the dictionary in 2008</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tu quoque</a></p>
<ul>
<li>It means "you also", which is an argument fallacy that discredits another person's point by bringing up an instance where that person has done that exact thing. A specific instance of this is "whataboutism".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>'ike (n.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hawaiian word for knowledge or understand</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>moku (n.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hawaiian word for island</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cocular Implants</p>
<ul>
<li>A type of implant for deaf people that bypasses the ear and uses an electrode to stimulate the brain directly</li>
<li>The brain can edit the world in real-time and map new sounds to the expected sounds such that it adapts the new sound to the expectation with amazing speed. It is like machine learning in real-time with active labeling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chartreuse</p>
<ul>
<li>A french liqueur with a strong herbal taste and it is made by Carthusian Monks following instructions written by Francois Annibal d'Estrees in 1605. named after the monastery "Grande Chartreuse"</li>
<li>Today, only two monks at Grande Chartreuse know the secret recipe to the green Chartreuse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starbucks</p>
<ul>
<li>The first mate in Moby Dick</li>
<li>One of the generalized words that I have not heard of, unlike kleenex, jacuzzi, frisbees, and band-aids, I didn't know that Starbucks was taken from the book Moby Dick. The brand consultant designed the logo first and saw the name of a town - Starbos and made him think about the first mate on the ship Pequod - Starbuck</li>

<p>Analog Computing</p>
<ul>
<li>Using voltage and conductance to perform matrix calculations</li>
<li>There is an immense application in <strong>deploying</strong> trained neural networks on analog computers because, at the end of the day, NN is just matrix multiplications.</li>
<li>However, the biggest drawback is in the perseverance of the signal, so the more layers the NN has the more impractical it becomes (a solution would be to transfer the analog signal to the digital signal and then send it to the next analog processor)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/bolton-strid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bolton Strid</a></p>
<ul>
<li>A river in Northern England that is considered the most dangerous water system that with a 100% mortality rate</li>
<li>Because it is a narrow but incredibly deep body of water. The water is squeezed through a narrow pass that greatly increases the water speed and increases the tribulation</li>

<p>Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission (EAFP)</p>
<ul>
<li>The Pythonic way to code</li>
<li>There are two coding styles when handling code fails: look before you leap (LBYL) and easier to ask for forgiveness than permission (EAFP)</li>
<li>LBYL is when you check for the existence of something before doing something with them</li>
<li>While EAFP is to do something and catch the error if it doesn't exist</li>

<p>Hofstadter's Law</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law" - Douglas Hofstadter

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Just like how our brain is not suited for compounding effects or exponential effects, we are just not equipped to make time estimates</li>
<li>The quote is also a self-referencing quote, which I've never seen. But Douglas Hofstadter seems to enjoy making them</li>

<ul>
<li>Currency can be pegged to another by enforcing a fixed exchange rate - which stabilizes the currency and gives confidence for long-term predictability</li>
<li>Stablecoins are often pegged to the US dollar</li>
<li>Luna crash in May 2022 caused several other networks to also crash which caused Tether (A stablecoin) to be depegged from the US dollar.</li>

<p><a href="https://historydaily.org/history-morton-salt-girl-umbrella" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"When it rains, it pours"</a></p>
<ul>
<li>It comes from Morton's Salt marketing team, to advertise the fact that their salt is free-flowing even when it is humid out</li>
<li>Back before Morton introduced their salt in 1911, salt often clumped together in storage and needed to be de-clumped on rainy days</li>

<p>Aliasing</p>
<ul>
<li>When different signals become indistinguishable from each other, this can be caused by sampling inappropriately</li>
<li>Or having difficult patterns for the camera sensors like fine stripes</li>
<li>Anti-aliasing settings in PC Games are techniques that reduce the jagged edges of the straight lines as a result of down-sampling</li>

<ul>
<li>When a country uses sports events to mask their problematic political actions</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia fund-backed LIV tour, Russia's Olympics, Quartar's world cup.</li>
<li>It is related to gastropolitics which is when a country uses cuisine to market the country's reputation</li>

<p>Montana mandates having the freshest milk</p>
<ul>
<li>Montana's "sell by" date for milk is shorter than any state in the US because it wants to have the "freshest" milk</li>
<li>But it just leads to a lot of unnecessary food waste and higher prices</li>

<p>Dominant Players</p>
<ul>
<li>Marion Tinsley was the most dominant checkers player that only lost 7 times and twice to Chinook (a checkers program). He was able to see almost 64 moves ahead to find winning positions.</li>
<li>Go Seigen is considered the most dominant GO player in the 20th century, his playstyle is very fast and free and was able to make judgments on large positions and win big points</li>
<li>Stu Ungar was considered the greatest Texas hold 'em and Gin and Rummy player</li>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/am-i-an-idiot-for-wanting-a-dumber-phone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Idiocy</a></p>
<ul>
<li>From the greek word <strong>idiotes</strong> which refers to someone who maintained little connection to the affairs of the state</li>
<li>It means "on one's own" or "private". The word <strong>idiosyncratic</strong> preserved that aspect of the meaning</li>
<li>It now purely has a negative connotation but in the past, it was a form of enlightenment - Socrates recognized he knew nothing and claimed that made him wiser than those who believed themselves to be smart</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-history-of-ampersand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&amp;</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The symbol <code>&amp;</code> was not always a symbol but a letter - the 27th letter that was a ligature of <code>e</code> and <code>t</code> which is <code>et</code> or <code>and</code> in Latin</li>
<li>The phrase ampersand came from the fact that there are letters like <code>I</code> and <code>A</code> that can also function as a word</li>
<li>So when you are referring to the use of the letter and not the word, you would use the phrase 'I per se, I", which meant "I by itself, I". When used on the quasi-letter <code>&amp;</code>, the phrase becomes "&amp; per se, and" which became "and per se, and" which became "ampersand"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ligature (n.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Something that is used to bind; something that unites or connects</li>

<p><a href="https://wiki.c*com/?TelescopeRule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telescope Rule</a></p>
<ul>
<li>"It is faster to make a four-inch mirror than a six-inch mirror than to make a six-inch mirror" - Programming Pearls</li>
<li>The jump to make a larger product is considerable and it is easier to develop the skills needed for a smaller product and iterate to the larger product</li>
<li>The parallel to this is in autonomous driving where there are two schools of thought:</li>
<li>Iterate autonomous driving from manual driving to fully autonomous - i.e. Tesla</li>
<li>Jump directly to fully autonomous driving - i.e. Waymo</li>
<li>The rationale for jumping directly to autonomous driving is that it is like building lego from simple structures to complex structures but you can never make the leap to building actual rockets</li>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>special</strong> placeholder value used in programming like <code>-1</code> or <code>999</code> to represent termination or <code>null</code> values</li>
<li>One should be very careful choosing a sentinel value that is unique in form and won't naturally appear in data or algorithm, for this reason, it is also sometimes called "elephant in Cairo"</li>

<p>Priority (n.)</p>
<ul>
<li>First appeared in the late 14th century to mean "state of being earlier (than something else), prior occurrence or existence"</li>
<li>It meant first which is singular, there was no concept of <strong>priorities</strong></li>
<li>Essentialism focuses on this concept and attempts to give people the focus required to achieve the priority in their life</li>

<p>Rule of thumb</p>
<ul>
<li>A common belief was that this phrase stemmed from a law that a husband is allowed to beat his wife with a stick no wider than his thumb. However, this law was found to be true. the earliest use of this phrase was back in the 1600s and the origin is still unknown</li>
<li>The logo for the video game Fallout has a cartoon character (Vault Boy) with his thumb out and one eye open because he is measuring the stem of the mushroom cloud with his thumb to determine if he needs to start evacuating the area</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gatekeeping is childish and it's a sign that people are insecure about their interests.</p>
<p>What is this counter-gatekeeping about then?</p>
<p>It's that kid in high-school skipping through the grades and graduating early. Like what is the rush?</p>
<p>Still not clear? Yeah, my bad - let’s give an example.</p>
<p>Say if you develop a new hobby in home coffee brewing it might look something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Informer - someone who learned there is a whole world beyond drip coffee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dabbler - someone who is starting to know the difference between pour-over and immersion brew and probably owns a home setup to brew their daily cups of coffee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gatekeeper (optional) -  someone who looks down on those that drink venti cold brew with half a cup of oat milk and a few packets of stevia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lifer - someone who appreciates the intricacies of coffee making but doesn’t try to convert everyone from their dog to their grandma into becoming a home barista</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I started to notice that I like to rush through this progression whenever I find a new hobby or a lane of interest.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Is it because I am scared of being labeled as a gatekeeper and I want to immediately jump past it?</p>
<p>It is because I think informer and dabbler are not worthwhile?</p>
<p>I think I should take more time to enjoy each step of the process and be okay with enjoying the "lesser" versions of that thing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, what is a second brain?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="brain-box" src="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/assets/images/pexels-shvets-production-7203692-f24c06c7cb80bda70dedfdf97f50c766.webp" width="750" height="500" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It is a place to store facts and ideas that you learned but may not need on a day-to-day basis. The reason to have a second brain is to keep your primary brain's cognitive activity free of clutter and not be bogged down with remembering numbers, names, and details. It can be focused on the process of understanding and reasoning knowledge.</p>
<p>Being an avid podcast listener, I was also aware that a lot of information just goes in one ear and out the other. The stories, quotes, and ideas from the podcasts were very engaging in the moment and I felt that I was <em>never</em> going to forget it. But time and time again, I failed to recall all the details when I want to bring up the story in a conversation.</p>
<p>I needed a way to store and access facts, so I can keep my brain free of clutter to focus on cognitive thinking.</p>
<p>I was researching this one day and found a book called <a href="https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“How to take Smart Notes"</a> which describes the process of a slip-box system that was used by Niklas Luhmann to write more prolifically. This note-taking system is a way of organizing thoughts and intermingling ideas to inspire new ones. The emphasis of this system is on the web of connections made between each thought. Also, it encourages you to write small ready-made pieces each time and when you want to write a longer piece - you just have to connect the pieces. This way, the daunting task of writing a full-length piece is broken down into smaller efforts each day.</p>
<p>This method is also known as the Zettelkasten Method which is German for "slip-box", and the original implementation uses index cards. Even though I love nothing more than an analog system, it is probably way too much of a hassle to maintain and update. And, the pain of searching for something is probably not worth the novelty.</p>
<p>So I turned to software.</p>
<p>I initially started with <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zettlr</a>. A decent program that is a markdown editor with bi-directional references and tagging. But I didn't get that "joy" factor when using it, it felt like a tool designed and intended for academic use.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="zettlr" src="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/assets/images/zettlr-cb224450ecc9fadd911b81c702eb7ca1.webp" width="750" height="454" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Then I discovered <a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roam Research</a> which is an online app that had a strong community behind it. This web app made creating and linking notes extremely easy and the interface was clean to start using without much friction but provided lots of depth for customization. I got into customizing the look and feel of it and had several templates to make daily note entries, book reviews, article summaries, and TIL entries. But I started to feel that the system is doing a good job collecting everything I attempt to write down but doesn't give me a good way to re-organize. I started to feel like it was a messy drawer where I can easily dump notes but was difficult to see how many notes I had and find the right notes at the right time. The web of notes kept growing outwards and they were not strengthening in connection with each other - the promise of generating new ideas was not fulfilled.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="roam-research" src="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/assets/images/roam-7d3dcdc0c6b825519dcffefc14468e23.webp" width="750" height="522" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In search of this filling of control, I decided to try <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a>. A full-fledged desktop app that looks like a glorified markdown editor, but has lots of small features that make untangling this mess of a web inside my second brain considerably easier.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was export and import all my notes from Roam, and Obsidian has a very helpful markdown importer tool to automatically reformat the syntax from Roam to Obsidian. Then, I reorganize all my existing notes into the <code>slip-box</code> folder which is divided like so:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">slip-box/</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">├─ reference-notes/</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ highlights-from-article.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ highlights-from-blog.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">├─ literature-notes/</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ idea-1-explained-in-my-own-words.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ idea-2-explained-in-my-own-words.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">├─ permanent-notes/</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ 2a-different-idea-explained.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ 1a-explanation-of-idea.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ 1a1-tangent-from-1a.md</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Most of the notes I had got dumped into <code>reference-notes</code>. There was also a small tree of permanent notes growing that I had forgotten about! It was lost in the woods of Roam and I re-read those and moved them into [permanent-notes]. Then I installed some community plugins to automate my daily notes routine. I used [calendar], [dataview], and [templater] in conjunction with [daily notes] to automagically create a daily note with a habit tracker, journal section, ephemeral notes for brain dumping, and dynamic links to notes I created or touched during the day.</p>
<p>With all this in place, I am starting to feel at home in my second brain.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not to bury the lead and beat around the bush - I own <strong>572</strong> (roughly) things right now.</p>
<p>So let’s rewind and go back to why did I do this. I was planning a move to San Francisco and right before I was starting to pack I came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8o8-EdZY0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> where Matt D’avella (kind of a modern-influencer minimalist) counted everything he owned. While I am by no means a minimalist, I do spend a lot of time debating whether I should purchase something or try my best to make things I already own to be as multifunctional as possible. For example, my longboard doubles up as my shoe-rack or just coffee mugs instead of different sizes and shapes for holding different types of liquids.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="dogs-playing" src="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/assets/images/dogs-playing-e521abd9c4c92ef5471efd354f514a0a.webp" width="1000" height="1334" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>my dog playing with her friend, the only shot of my longboard shoe-rack</p>
<p>On top of multi-purposing, whenever I want to purchase anything new, I usually write it down on one of several shopping lists I have on my phone and evaluate the need for it by how frequently I try to re-add this item when an instance where I felt like my life would be much easier if I could use that item. Since I have kind of this reduction approach to buying material things, I thought it could also mean I don’t own too many things - so it shouldn’t be too hard to count everything up while I packed. Right?</p>
<p>Ground rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>pair of things counted as one thing</li>
<li>multi-paged documents counted as one thing (like how I would count a book)</li>
<li>wires used for purposes other than power counted as separate things</li>
<li>batteries where I have replacements of count as separate things</li>
<li>consumables - food or products - didn’t count.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the breakdown.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="count-of-things" src="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/assets/images/count-of-things-9a14d1a689407eb2e06e92f05142e7eb.webp" width="750" height="463" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Surprisingly, “clothing” was the largest category at nearly 30% with 153 items. I wasn’t expecting this because I thought I kept quite a lean closet with just basic items that I wear everyday. Also add in the fact that it is sunny all-year around in California I trimmed out most of my wet/cold/hailing/snowing/depressing clothing from Canada.</p>
<p>I was expecting kitchen to be in number one spot because I own a few too many coffee mugs and thought that there is just a minimum number of essential kitchen equipments you need if you are cooking at home regularly.</p>
<p>However, these two categories are probably the least notable to someone who is trying to guesstimate how many things they might own. Because they are often organized away in shelves and take up little space compared to furniture, electronics and decor. While these items do take up more space, I only own a combined 81 items in these three categories. Don’t fall into the trap of underestimating because those are the obvious large items you can easily count.</p>
<p>Was this whole thing a waste of time? Well depends. I might do this every time I move so I can get a sense if I am getting bloated with more items or not. Even if I don’t end up doing that it was still kind of interesting to see how many things you own and really consider how they add to your life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I always lament the fact that I forgot all the random things I learned over the year, so in 2021 I made an effort to note down the things I learned just to make this post at the end of the year to look back and remember it again.</p>
<p>So the first ever TIL annual review is for the year 2021, which might be remembered as the year where we thought COVID was over and the world will go back to being “normal” but it pulled an uno reverse on us and now we are in lockdown <del>#4</del> #5 and booster <del>#2</del> #3. Though… the bigger problem might be the growing distrust between the public and neutral organizations that is suppose to provide scientific recommendations. Whoa this got heavy real quick but it is also kinda how every normal conversation seems to nose-dive to these days.</p>

<p>This rabbit hole lead to a few more linguistic TILs.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loanword</a>
A word that is left untranslated from another language and permanently adopted as is. Some great examples I found are: tofu (Chinese - duofu), cafe (French - café), kindergarten (German - kinder[child]garten[garden]), calque (French - calque), deja vu (French - déjà vu).</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a <a href="https://wold.clld.org/vocabulary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole database</a> of loaned words and English, which does not surprise me, is one of top languages with borrowed words but it is also the most loaned word language to other languages. While Mandarin has the least loaned words from other languages.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calque" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calque</a>
A word or phrase that is translated literally word-for-word from another language. For example, “skyscraper” is a calque in many other languages and “flea market” is a calque from French term marché aux puces (market of fleas).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verbund (n.)
German word that means “the physical integration of products”, when the by-product of the assembly for one product can be used in another assembly line. This is the metaphor used for note-taking techniques that allows ideas and knowledge to mix together to create new thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Active Inhibition (n.)
Actively build a mind filter between free-flowing thoughts and long-term memory, this helps with avoiding being flooded with memories when consciously problem solving. This is one of the goals of note-taking!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kakorrhaphiophobia (n.)
The fear of failure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A tangential fear is the fear of long words and the people who named it were sick deviants because it is one of the longest words in the English dictionary - <strong>Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia</strong>.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<p>Zeigarnik Effect (n.)
The tolling effect that open tasks can have on our minds, it is why writing a to-do list can help declutter our mind because it tricks our mind that it is closed. However, this can be leveraged for difficult problems by keeping them “open” in our mind and letting our conscious/unconscious self to ruminate over it.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitz_Roy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fitz Traverse</a> or Fitz Roy
A skyline in Patagonia, Argentina that was first traversed by Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold in February 2014. They were assisted by another group that started at the same time (Rolando Garibotti and Colin Haley) but they stopped halfway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/brief-history-peanut-butter-180976525/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peanut Butter</a>
Originally invented by the Incas, but re-popularized by John Harvey Kellogg, he made this compound for patients at the Battle Creek Sanitarium as it is easily digestible. Kellogg promoted plant-based diet over meat and with his clientele of Amelia Earhart, Sojourner Truth and Henry Ford helped establish peanut butter as a delicacy. During WWI, there was meat rationing so Americans substituted meat with peanut butter.</p>

</ol>
<p>Usually we add leap second after a few years to compensate for the slowing effects, but we may need to add a <em>negative leap second</em> and can have unintended consequences on technology that depends on "true time".</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Stanning (v.)
Added to the Oxford dictionary in 2018, to mean an overzealous or obsessive fan. Inspired by Eminem's song "Stan", released in 2000.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is crazy to me that the original song didn’t elevate the word back then but it is the k-pop culture that adopted this word and caused it to be added to the dictionary.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Sonder (n.)
Just an amazing word, it describes the realization that everyone you pass by is living a life as vivid, memorable and important as your own.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"The realization that each random passerby is living as life as vivid and complex as your own - populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness - an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you 'll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk." - The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="14">
<li>Temporal Illusion
An illusion that plays on our perception of time.</li>
</ol>
<p>We experience time in two ways, <em>prospectively</em> - actively through the passage of time, and <em>retrospectively</em> - recalling the passage of time.</p>
<p>One illusion we experience with empty or full events (boring or exciting events) is that the empty events feel long prospectively but short retrospectively while the full events feel short prospectively but long retrospectively.</p>
<p>This leads to the TV illusion which is a prominent experience of modern life, where you feel time passes by while you are experiencing it and when you recall upon it.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Oleka
The realization that only a few days are memorable.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our lives are built of the same few notes, repeated over and over. It's not a grand symphony, full of surprises. It's a song sung in canon, that simply carries on, until the tune gets stuck in your head.

</blockquote>
<ol start="16">
<li>No Free Lunch Theorem
David Wolpert in a famous paper (1996) showed that if you make no assumptions about the data, there is no reason to choose one model over another. There is no way to know ahead of time that one model will work better than another.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, to practically build models you have to make some assumptions.</p>

<p>Euthymia (n.)
It describes the state when you believe in yourself and trust that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad of footpaths of those wandering in every direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pati (n.)

</li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin root of the English word passion.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Scopophobia (n.)
Fear of being seen or the center of attention. What drives our fear of public speaking so much, which is said to be most people's biggest fear - even over death!</li>
</ol>

<li>Tulip Mania
A term that refers to any economic bubble when the price of the item is inflated beyond its own "intrinsic" value</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally regarded as the first speculative bubble, as the price for tulip bulb drastically increased during the Dutch Golden Age (1581 - 1672) and crashed in 1637 February</p>

<li>
<p>Xenia (n.)
Greek word for their rule of showing generosity and hospitality to guests who are far from home. It translates to “guest-friendship”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Halting Problem
A problem in computing theory that asks if you were given the description of an arbitrary program and input, can you determine if the program will finish running or run forever</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Alan Turing in 1936 proved that a general algorithm to solve this problem for all program-input pairs is not possible. This proof is contingent on the mathematical definition of a computer and program.</p>

<p>Note: Did a side-by-side taste test between the Perger and 40/60 method. The subtle honey and black leaf aromas were more prominent in the Perger method, whereas the acidity dominated the taste profile in the 40/60 method. Because of the interesting aromas with this particular bean, the Perger method is preferred.</p>

<p>After almost two weeks without proper coffee, I bought some beans from Sumatra, Indonesia to try. It was brewed in the Chemex with the usual ratio of 1:16.7, and the resulting brew had a slightly juicy body that gets sour the more sips you take. The first notes were definitely earthy and herbal - the card indicated tobacco as one of the notes - but obviously I can’t start to tell the difference tobacco, cedar and wood. Then the subsequent notes are sharp, dry and acidic.</p>
<p>Not sure if I enjoyed this one, it is not a combination I particularly enjoy. Which means I probably should write a mental note here - <strong>DON’T BUY SUMATRA INDONESIAN BEANS AGAIN!</strong></p>

<p>During the summertime, I prefer to cold brew my coffee. This year I learned about Japanese cold pour over - which is much faster to prepare compared to the traditional cold brew. Instead of brewing overnight, Japanese cold pour over uses ice to instantly cool the hot coffee to a refreshing temperature.</p>
<p>To make this, you start by heating the vessel and wet the filter paper with boiling water. Then you add about ~150g of ice into the vessel before making any coffee. Then you slowly pour about 200ml of water over finely grind coffee beans with the usual bloom and pour steps. As the final drips of water is filtered through, you add about ~100g of ice into the coffee to finish.</p>
<p>At the end you have a cup of nicely chilled coffee to start the summer day.</p>

<p>About 6 months ago, I got a Hario v60 dripper for my morning brews. Since I am the only coffee drinker in the house, making a single cup with the 6-cup Chemex seems awfully wasteful. With the smaller dripper, it allowed me to explore different pour methods and test their differences in my daily cup of coffee.</p>
<p>I use the Baratza Encore on setting 21 to grind the beans for all of the pour methods.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-perger-method">The Perger Method<a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/blog/brew-logs-2018#the-perger-method" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Perger Method" title="Direct link to The Perger Method">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Coffee - 12g</li>
<li>Water - 200ml</li>
<li>Pour - 50ml bloom, 50ml @ 30s, 100ml @60s</li>
</ul>
<p>Matt Perger's technique is very simple and easy to replicate. It produces a softer cup with less accentuation to the sweetness and acidity of the beans. I usually make a cup with 27g of coffee while keeping the same coffee<!-- -->:water<!-- --> ratio. This method scales well with different amounts of coffee because dividing the water into three distinct pours allow control without being too finicky.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-6-method">4-6 Method<a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/blog/brew-logs-2018#4-6-method" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4-6 Method" title="Direct link to 4-6 Method">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Coffee - 20g</li>
<li>Water - 300ml</li>
<li>Pour - 40% of water in two pours, 60% of water in as many pours as you want</li>
</ul>
<p>This award winning technique by Tetsu Kasuya is nuanced and more difficult to perform. However, I love the precision this pour gives to the flavor of the final cup. The idea of this method is the 40% component determines the balance between acidity and sweetness. The more water one uses in the first pour of this component, the more acidic the final cup will be, and vice versa. The 60% component determines the strength of the coffee. If one divides the 60% of water with more number of pours, the stronger the coffee will be. Since this method also calls for a slightly higher coffee<!-- -->:water<!-- --> ratio, the resulting cup is more flavorful. I always chose to use this method with a fresh batch of beans to experience the palette for the first time.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="continuous-pour">Continuous Pour<a href="https://your-docusaurus-test-site.com/blog/brew-logs-2018#continuous-pour" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Continuous Pour" title="Direct link to Continuous Pour">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Coffee - 27g</li>
<li>Water - 450ml</li>
<li>Pour - initial bloom, then pour the rest slowly in a circular pattern, aim for 2:00 - 2:30 brew time</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of pouring water in distinct batches and waiting for each batch of water to completely dissipate through the grounds, this method continuously add water after the bloom step. Begin by pre-wetting the ground with 75g or so of water (depends on how much coffee there is). Actively dig through the grounds to ensure there are no dry spots and the gases are released from the freshly grind beans. Then pouring in slow and steady circles around the center of the v60, near but not on the edge of the grounds. Allow water to build up as high as possible without spilling. Rao spin can be achieved through this continuous pour. The Rao spin is a way to achieve a flatter bed to allow for even extraction (although not actually invented by Scott Rao). Another way to achieve a flatter bed is to carefully thump the v60 down on the cup and gravity should even out the grinds. Although this method doesn't allow for customization of the flavor, it is consistent in producing the same cup over and over again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been a while since I’ve had the time to try new beans. Today I brewed two cups of Ethiopia Limu beans with the intent of testing two different grind settings. Usually, I grind at 21 on the Baratza Encore for pour-over because it was a number I found online and I never thought too much of it.</p>
<p>I figured the internet is never wrong, why bother checking it.</p>
<p>But that’s half the fun of brewing at home, you get to tinker with the little levers and dial into your favorite setup. So I brewed two cups with the ratio of 200 ml of water to 12.5 g of coffee, and the same pour method of 4 pours with a 60 ml bloom, 120 ml, 180 ml and 20 ml Rao Spin to finish. The Rao Spin gives you an even bed of grounds to end the extraction process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Note: New coffee specialty shop opened on Bay and Wellesley, they do all kinds of brews from Turkish to Siphon. I tried two kinds of beans, the one from Brazil is the clear favourite with a more balanced and rich body over the one from El Salvador which is fruitier and sharper. Also trying a new brewing method from Tetsu Kasuya - 40/60 method which is a way to manually control the sweet and sour balance and strength level independently.</p>

<p>Note: Upgraded the dinky hand grinder with the Baratza electrical burr grinder. The consistency with the grounds this electrical grinder produces is so much more superior to the hand grinder. It is well worth the $120 investment. The coffee beans are not my favourite, I bought it mostly because it came in a nice anniversary tin. So I can use it to store coffee in the future.</p>

<p>Note: Walked by a coffee shop I used to go on Baldwin and decided to pick up their roastry's beans on a whim. Great decision. I was first skeptical of the lemon/lime aftertaste, weary of it might overpower the beans, but it was just subtle enough that you only notice the taste as the coffee is swallowed. It leaves your palette clean and it is a wonderful ending note for this roast. Afterwards, I realized I left the grind setting from the coldbrew sessions, that left me confused as to which grind size I prefer for this bean.</p>

<p>Note: First time trying cold brew, a little late with the seasons but whatever. It wasn't too bad, a bit strong compared to Starbucks ones. That is, until I realized that at Starbucks they dilute the coffee with water before they serve it. So I tried that to temper the taste. Finally found a good use for the terrible vanilla beans I bought from Costco, it makes terrible pour overs and now it will be only used for cold brews.</p>
