            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using FitBit and Whoop to monitor my sleep quality over two weeks from 2021-12-12 to 2021-12-23 and this is what I found</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="context">Context<a class="hash-link" href="#context" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When I mention that I am looking into how to sleep better, my friends and family first instinct is always "oh are you having trouble sleeping?"
It is not that I have trouble sleeping, it is just that I want to optimize sleep to the absolute maximum.
The importance of good quality sleep is increasingly being understood as the <strong>single most important factor to health</strong>.
Wouldn't I want this to be optimized better than my monster-hunter charge blade build?</p><p>The focus of this monitoring is to see which device correlate with my personal experience better so I can start to trust its outputs.</p><p>I will wear both devices on each of my wrists and flip halfway through after a week. And note how each night's sleep correlated with how I felt.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="components">Components<a class="hash-link" href="#components" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In terms of sleep length:</p><ul><li>FitBit tracked an average of 6.8 hours for both weeks</li><li>Whoop tracked that I slept for an average of 6.5 hours (with 8 hours in bed) in the first week and an average of 5.1 hours (6 hours in bed) for second week</li></ul><p>And for sleep quality:</p><ul><li>FitBit tracked a score of 70 for both weeks</li><li>Whoop tracked 71% and 52% performance</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="issues">Issues<a class="hash-link" href="#issues" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Why was there a huge discrepancy in the second week?
This leads to the issue I had with Whoop, the sensors are less forgiving if its not worn properly. Some examples of this are:</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->table<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->

<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->tr<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->

<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->td<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->p<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->And cases where we see that even if the total hours is close.
<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->br<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> The allocation of the sleep stages is mismatched.
<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->/p<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->/td<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->/tr<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->/table<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>&lt;<!-- -->table<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->tr<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->td<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->img src="fitbit_20221214-061811.webp"  alt="1" width ="360" height ="640"<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->/td<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->td<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->img src="whoop_20221214-062857.webp" alt="2" width ="360" height ="640"<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->/td<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->td<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->p<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->There are times where it matched up well.<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->/p<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->/td<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->/tr<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->/table<!-- -->&gt;</p><p>But the problem is that it is very inconsistent.
And beyond this, I don't fully feel correlated with the results tracked by either devices.
More often than not, I feel well rested and did not wake up in the middle of the night as opposed to what the results show me - that I slept very lightly and woke several times.
Although FitBit is more consistent in measuring my sleep, it seems to under-estimate the hours and quality.</p><p>From what I have read and learned by speaking to friends in the wearable tech.
The basic hardware technology is identical across the different wearables, and what makes the differences is the algorithm used to determine sleep based on the signals the hardware is sending.
Depending on how the algorithm is tuned, the resulting analysis can vary from device to device.
Maybe Google trained their algorithm on someone who has a lower heart rate or less movement...but it doesn't test well on me.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="outcome">Outcome<a class="hash-link" href="#outcome" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I will definitely not be switching to Whoop, since it is more expensive and less consistent in tracking sleep for me.
A side note, the strain calculation is pretty spot on, but I never recover enough for it.
Even though, FitBit underestimates my total sleep, I think it does a good job on being consistent in its analysis and I can just do manual adjustments from the baseline.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[First of all, what is a second brain?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, what is a second brain?</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="brain-box" src="/assets/images/pexels-shvets-production-7203692-f24c06c7cb80bda70dedfdf97f50c766.webp" width="750" height="500" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It is a place to store facts and ideas that you learned but may not need on a day-to-day basis. The reason to have a second brain is to keep your primary brain's cognitive activity free of clutter and not be bogged down with remembering numbers, names, and details. It can be focused on the process of understanding and reasoning knowledge.</p><p>Being an avid podcast listener, I was also aware that a lot of information just goes in one ear and out the other. The stories, quotes, and ideas from the podcasts were very engaging in the moment and I felt that I was <em>never</em> going to forget it. But time and time again, I failed to recall all the details when I want to bring up the story in a conversation.</p><p>I needed a way to store and access facts, so I can keep my brain free of clutter to focus on cognitive thinking.</p><p>I was researching this one day and found a book called <a href="https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“How to take Smart Notes"</a> which describes the process of a slip-box system that was used by Niklas Luhmann to write more prolifically. This note-taking system is a way of organizing thoughts and intermingling ideas to inspire new ones. The emphasis of this system is on the web of connections made between each thought. Also, it encourages you to write small ready-made pieces each time and when you want to write a longer piece - you just have to connect the pieces. This way, the daunting task of writing a full-length piece is broken down into smaller efforts each day.</p><p>This method is also known as the Zettelkasten Method which is German for "slip-box", and the original implementation uses index cards. Even though I love nothing more than an analog system, it is probably way too much of a hassle to maintain and update. And, the pain of searching for something is probably not worth the novelty.</p><p>So I turned to software.</p><p>I initially started with <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zettlr</a>. A decent program that is a markdown editor with bi-directional references and tagging. But I didn't get that "joy" factor when using it, it felt like a tool designed and intended for academic use.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="zettlr" src="/assets/images/zettlr-cb224450ecc9fadd911b81c702eb7ca1.webp" width="750" height="454" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Then I discovered <a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roam Research</a> which is an online app that had a strong community behind it. This web app made creating and linking notes extremely easy and the interface was clean to start using without much friction but provided lots of depth for customization. I got into customizing the look and feel of it and had several templates to make daily note entries, book reviews, article summaries, and TIL entries. But I started to feel that the system is doing a good job collecting everything I attempt to write down but doesn't give me a good way to re-organize. I started to feel like it was a messy drawer where I can easily dump notes but was difficult to see how many notes I had and find the right notes at the right time. The web of notes kept growing outwards and they were not strengthening in connection with each other - the promise of generating new ideas was not fulfilled.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="roam-research" src="/assets/images/roam-7d3dcdc0c6b825519dcffefc14468e23.webp" width="750" height="522" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In search of this filling of control, I decided to try <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a>. A full-fledged desktop app that looks like a glorified markdown editor, but has lots of small features that make untangling this mess of a web inside my second brain considerably easier.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="obsidian" src="/assets/images/obsidian-promo-2185b5921c82d8abcb0b1f753ea0771a.webp" width="750" height="443" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The first thing I did was export and import all my notes from Roam, and Obsidian has a very helpful markdown importer tool to automatically reformat the syntax from Roam to Obsidian. Then, I reorganize all my existing notes into the <code>slip-box</code> folder which is divided like so:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">slip-box/</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">├─ reference-notes/</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ highlights-from-article.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ highlights-from-blog.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">├─ literature-notes/</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ idea-1-explained-in-my-own-words.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ idea-2-explained-in-my-own-words.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">├─ permanent-notes/</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ 2a-different-idea-explained.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ 1a-explanation-of-idea.md</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">│  ├─ 1a1-tangent-from-1a.md</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Most of the notes I had got dumped into <code>reference-notes</code>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not to bury the lead and beat around the bush - I own <strong>572</strong> (roughly) things right now.</p><p>So let’s rewind and go back to why did I do this. I was planning a move to San Francisco and right before I was starting to pack I came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8o8-EdZY0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> where Matt D’avella (kind of a modern-influencer minimalist) counted everything he owned. While I am by no means a minimalist, I do spend a lot of time debating whether I should purchase something or try my best to make things I already own to be as multifunctional as possible. For example, my longboard doubles up as my shoe-rack or just coffee mugs instead of different sizes and shapes for holding different types of liquids.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="dogs-playing" src="/assets/images/dogs-playing-e521abd9c4c92ef5471efd354f514a0a.webp" width="1000" height="1334" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>my dog playing with her friend, the only shot of my longboard shoe-rack</p><p>On top of multi-purposing, whenever I want to purchase anything new, I usually write it down on one of several shopping lists I have on my phone and evaluate the need for it by how frequently I try to re-add this item when an instance where I felt like my life would be much easier if I could use that item. Since I have kind of this reduction approach to buying material things, I thought it could also mean I don’t own too many things - so it shouldn’t be too hard to count everything up while I packed. Right?</p><p>Ground rules:</p><ul><li>pair of things counted as one thing</li><li>multi-paged documents counted as one thing (like how I would count a book)</li><li>wires used for purposes other than power counted as separate things</li><li>batteries where I have replacements of count as separate things</li><li>consumables - food or products - didn’t count.</li></ul><p>Here is the breakdown.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="count-of-things" src="/assets/images/count-of-things-9a14d1a689407eb2e06e92f05142e7eb.webp" width="750" height="463" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Surprisingly, “clothing” was the largest category at nearly 30% with 153 items. I wasn’t expecting this because I thought I kept quite a lean closet with just basic items that I wear everyday. Also add in the fact that it is sunny all-year around in California I trimmed out most of my wet/cold/hailing/snowing/depressing clothing from Canada.</p><p>I was expecting kitchen to be in number one spot because I own a few too many coffee mugs and thought that there is just a minimum number of essential kitchen equipments you need if you are cooking at home regularly.</p><p>However, these two categories are probably the least notable to someone who is trying to guesstimate how many things they might own. Because they are often organized away in shelves and take up little space compared to furniture, electronics and decor. While these items do take up more space, I only own a combined 81 items in these three categories. Don’t fall into the trap of underestimating because those are the obvious large items you can easily count.</p><p>Was this whole thing a waste of time? Well depends. I might do this every time I move so I can get a sense if I am getting bloated with more items or not. Even if I don’t end up doing that it was still kind of interesting to see how many things you own and really consider how they add to your life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Originally invented by the Incas, but re-popularized by John Harvey Kellogg, he made this compound for patients at the Battle Creek Sanitarium as it is easily digestible. Kellogg promoted plant-based diet over meat and with his clientele of Amelia Earhart, Sojourner Truth and Henry Ford helped establish peanut butter as a delicacy.

Just an amazing word, it describes the realization that everyone you pass by is living a life as vivid, memorable and important as your own.</li></ol><blockquote><p>"The realization that each random passerby is living as life as vivid and complex as your own - populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness - an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you 'll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk." - The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</p></blockquote><ol start="14"><li>Temporal Illusion
An illusion that plays on our perception of time.</li></ol><p>We experience time in two ways, <em>prospectively</em> - actively through the passage of time, and <em>retrospectively</em> - recalling the passage of time.</p><p>One illusion we experience with empty or full events (boring or exciting events) is that the empty events feel long prospectively but short retrospectively while the full events feel short prospectively but long retrospectively.</p><p>This leads to the TV illusion which is a prominent experience of modern life, where you feel time passes by while you are experiencing it and when you recall upon it.</p><ol start="15"><li>Oleka
The realization that only a few days are memorable.</li></ol><blockquote><p>“Our lives are built of the same few notes, repeated over and over. It's not a grand symphony, full of surprises.

The subtle honey and black leaf aromas were more prominent in the Perger method, whereas the acidity dominated the taste profile in the 40/60 method. Because of the interesting aromas with this particular bean, the Perger method is preferred.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="may-2018">May 2018<a class="hash-link" href="#may-2018" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>After almost two weeks without proper coffee, I bought some beans from Sumatra, Indonesia to try. It was brewed in the Chemex with the usual ratio of 1:16.7, and the resulting brew had a slightly juicy body that gets sour the more sips you take. The first notes were definitely earthy and herbal - the card indicated tobacco as one of the notes - but obviously I can’t start to tell the difference tobacco, cedar and wood. Then the subsequent notes are sharp, dry and acidic.</p><p>Not sure if I enjoyed this one, it is not a combination I particularly enjoy. Which means I probably should write a mental note here - <strong>DON’T BUY SUMATRA INDONESIAN BEANS AGAIN!</strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="august-2018-pour-over-cold-brew">August 2018 (Pour over cold brew)<a class="hash-link" href="#august-2018-pour-over-cold-brew" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Beans: Kicking horse 454 horsepower</li><li>Grind Size: 10</li><li>Coffee Portion: 25g</li><li>Water Portion: 200 ml</li><li>Ice portion: 250 g</li><li>Brew Time: ~2:00</li><li>Taste: Strong, oily and bitter</li><li>Rate: 7/10</li></ul><p>During the summertime, I prefer to cold brew my coffee. This year I learned about Japanese cold pour over - which is much faster to prepare compared to the traditional cold brew. Instead of brewing overnight, Japanese cold pour over uses ice to instantly cool the hot coffee to a refreshing temperature.</p><p>To make this, you start by heating the vessel and wet the filter paper with boiling water. Then you add about ~150g of ice into the vessel before making any coffee. Then you slowly pour about 200ml of water over finely grind coffee beans with the usual bloom and pour steps. As the final drips of water is filtered through, you add about ~100g of ice into the coffee to finish.</p><p>At the end you have a cup of nicely chilled coffee to start the summer day.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="v60-pour-methods">v60 Pour Methods<a class="hash-link" href="#v60-pour-methods" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>About 6 months ago, I got a Hario v60 dripper for my morning brews. Since I am the only coffee drinker in the house, making a single cup with the 6-cup Chemex seems awfully wasteful. With the smaller dripper, it allowed me to explore different pour methods and test their differences in my daily cup of coffee.</p><p>I use the Baratza Encore on setting 21 to grind the beans for all of the pour methods.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-perger-method">The Perger Method<a class="hash-link" href="#the-perger-method" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Coffee - 12g</li><li>Water - 200ml</li><li>Pour - 50ml bloom, 50ml @ 30s, 100ml @60s</li></ul><p>Matt Perger's technique is very simple and easy to replicate. It produces a softer cup with less accentuation to the sweetness and acidity of the beans. I usually make a cup with 27g of coffee while keeping the same coffee:water ratio. This method scales well with different amounts of coffee because dividing the water into three distinct pours allow control without being too finicky.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-6-method">4-6 Method<a class="hash-link" href="#4-6-method" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Coffee - 20g</li><li>Water - 300ml</li><li>Pour - 40% of water in two pours, 60% of water in as many pours as you want</li></ul><p>This award winning technique by Tetsu Kasuya is nuanced and more difficult to perform. However, I love the precision this pour gives to the flavor of the final cup. The idea of this method is the 40% component determines the balance between acidity and sweetness. The more water one uses in the first pour of this component, the more acidic the final cup will be, and vice versa. The 60% component determines the strength of the coffee. If one divides the 60% of water with more number of pours, the stronger the coffee will be. Since this method also calls for a slightly higher coffee:water ratio, the resulting cup is more flavorful. I always chose to use this method with a fresh batch of beans to experience the palette for the first time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="continuous-pour">Continuous Pour<a class="hash-link" href="#continuous-pour" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Coffee - 27g</li><li>Water - 450ml</li><li>Pour - initial bloom, then pour the rest slowly in a circular pattern, aim for 2:00 - 2:30 brew time</li></ul><p>Instead of pouring water in distinct batches and waiting for each batch of water to completely dissipate through the grounds, this method continuously add water after the bloom step. Begin by pre-wetting the ground with 75g or so of water (depends on how much coffee there is). Actively dig through the grounds to ensure there are no dry spots and the gases are released from the freshly grind beans. Then pouring in slow and steady circles around the center of the v60, near but not on the edge of the grounds. Allow water to build up as high as possible without spilling. Rao spin can be achieved through this continuous pour. The Rao spin is a way to achieve a flatter bed to allow for even extraction (although not actually invented by Scott Rao). Another way to achieve a flatter bed is to carefully thump the v60 down on the cup and gravity should even out the grinds. Although this method doesn't allow for customization of the flavor, it is consistent in producing the same cup over and over again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Today I brewed two cups of Ethiopia Limu beans with the intent of testing two different grind settings. Usually, I grind at 21 on the Baratza Encore for pour-over because it was a number I found online and I never thought too much of it.</p><p>I figured the internet is never wrong, why bother checking it.</p><p>But that’s half the fun of brewing at home, you get to tinker with the little levers and dial into your favorite setup. So I brewed two cups with the ratio of 200 ml of water to 12.5 g of coffee, and the same pour method of 4 pours with a 60 ml bloom, 120 ml, 180 ml and 20 ml Rao Spin to finish. The Rao Spin gives you an even bed of grounds to end the extraction process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I tried two kinds of beans, the one from Brazil is the clear favourite with a more balanced and rich body over the one from El Salvador which is fruitier and sharper. Also trying a new brewing method from Tetsu Kasuya - 40/60 method which is a way to manually control the sweet and sour balance and strength level independently.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="january-2017">January 2017<a class="hash-link" href="#january-2017" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Beans: Kicking horse beans</li><li>Grind Size: 21</li><li>Coffee Portion: 27 g</li><li>Water Portion: 450 ml</li><li>Brew Time: 2:25</li><li>Color: Deep dark black</li><li>Taste: Sharp and acidic</li><li>Rate: 7/10</li></ul><p>Note: Upgraded the dinky hand grinder with the Baratza electrical burr grinder. The consistency with the grounds this electrical grinder produces is so much more superior to the hand grinder. It is well worth the $120 investment. The coffee beans are not my favourite, I bought it mostly because it came in a nice anniversary tin.

Great decision. I was first skeptical of the lemon/lime aftertaste, weary of it might overpower the beans, but it was just subtle enough that you only notice the taste as the coffee is swallowed. It leaves your palette clean and it is a wonderful ending note for this roast. Afterwards, I realized I left the grind setting from the coldbrew sessions, that left me confused as to which grind size I prefer for this bean.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="september-2015-coldbrew">September 2015 (COLDBREW)<a class="hash-link" href="#september-2015-coldbrew" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Beans: Zavida Hazelnut Vanilla Bean</li><li>Grind Size: 2.5 notches visible - Coarse * Grind</li><li>Coffee Portion: 50 g</li><li>Water Portion: 200 ml</li><li>Brew Time: 11:00:00</li><li>Color: "Clear", not muddled with any oil <em> or texture, looks just like black colored </em> water</li><li>Taste: Clean and sweeter due to the cold * water extraction</li><li>Rate: 7/10</li></ul><p>Note: First time trying cold brew, a little late with the seasons but whatever. It wasn't too bad, a bit strong compared to Starbucks ones. That is, until I realized that at Starbucks they dilute the coffee with water before they serve it. So I tried that to temper the taste. Finally found a good use for the terrible vanilla beans I bought from Costco, it makes terrible pour overs and now it will be only used for cold brews.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="july-2015">July 2015<a class="hash-link" href="#july-2015" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Beans: Ethiopian Yirgacheffe Bean</li><li>Grind Size: 3.5 notches visible - Medium * Coarse Grind</li><li>Coffee Portion: 27 g</li><li>Water Portion: 450 ml</li><li>Brew Time: 3:10</li><li>Color: Transitions from dark black to a * creamy brown around the rim</li><li>Taste: Light, mellow and sweet with hints <em> of floral aftertaste, not sharp or harsh. </em> Very easy to drink and neutral.</li><li>Rate: 10/10</li></ul><p>Note: Favorite beans so far, the beans were purchased at a local roaster in St.Lawrence Market near Front Street at Downtown Toronto.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="april-2015">April 2015<a class="hash-link" href="#april-2015" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>Beans: Continental Dark Roast</li><li>Grind Size: 3.5 notches visible - Medium * Coarse Grind</li><li>Coffee Portion: 24 g</li><li>Water Portion: 287 ml</li><li>Brew Time: 4:51</li><li>Color: Oily film on top and incredibly * dark</li><li>Taste: Bitter with a rough aftertaste, * Americano-esque.</li><li>Rate: 5/10</li></ul><p>Note: Fresh beans was notably different during brew, as more oxygen was released.
