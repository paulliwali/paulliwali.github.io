But this paradox describes the increased efficiency in using a resource <em>can actually</em> lead to the higher usage of said resource and the combined effect is faster depletion of the resource</li><li>This was observed by economist William Jevons when he noted that the consumption of coal increased after the invention of the Watt steam engine</li><li>This could be caused by the fact that increased efficiency leads to a decrease in price which can increase demand if the commodity follows an elastic demand curve</li></ul></li><li><p>Flocked Christmas Trees (n.)</p><ul><li>Christmas trees with fake snow.</li><li>Flocking is the process of creating texture by attaching tiny fibers to a material.
