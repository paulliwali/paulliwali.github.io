Paradox</a><ul><li>Bertrand Russell in 1901 showed that every set theory that contains an unrestricted comprehension principle leads to contradictions<ul><li>Discovered independently by Ernst Zermelo in 1899</li></ul></li><li>Unrestricted comprehension principle is that for any sufficiently well-defined property, there is the set of all and only the objects that have that property</li><li>Explaining this paradox in layman&#x27;s term * I have two examples<ul><li>Barber paradox: a barber is &quot;one who shaves all those, and those only, who do not shave themselves&quot; and the question is * does the barber shave themself?<ul><li>If the barber shaves themselves then by the definition above, he is no longer a barber</li><li>But if barber doesn&#x27;t shave themself then he belongs in the group of people that needs to be shaved by a barber which is themself</li></ul></li><li>The other is: all rules have exceptions<ul><li>If this is a rule, then

card machines predates computers<ul><li>I have always associated punch cards with the old computers that took up an entire floor and thinking about handing in computer assignments that were in binder full of punch cards and accidentally feeding them in the wrong order and having the program crash</li><li>However, they were used in the late 18th and early 19th century for looms to weave different

days, but was exhausted from the journey. A monk brewed some tea and he was able to continue his journey and ended up with the top score. On the way home, he paid tribute to the tree where the tea was from by putting his red robe from attaining the top score around it</li><li>There are 6 trees in the rocks of Jiu Long Ke in Wuyi, Fujian which have been around for 360 years</li><li>According to folklore, the teas from these trees were sent as tribute to the Emperor<ul><li>In 1998, 20g of tea produced from these trees were auctioned for 20,000 USD</li><li>It is no longer allowed to harvest from these trees as they are protected national heritage</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Hemingway Cats<ul><li>These are 6-toed cats (polydactyle) cats that live on Hemingway&#x27;s property<ul><li>They all carry the gene but half exhibit the physical trait</li></ul></li><li>Ernest Hemingway was given a 6-toed cat by a ship&#x27;s captain<ul><li>His residence on Key West is relatively isolated, so the descendents are kept relatively within the same gene pool</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Whale Falls<ul><li>The phenomenon where a large carcasses like a whale can fall onto the deep ocean floor intact</li><li>Discovered in 1987, by the submersible vessels that was used in the Titanic Salvage</li><li>These contain complex localized ecosystem for sea organisms for decades</li></ul></li><li>Duck Tape<ul><li>Originates from duck cloth (from the Dutch word doek) which was a heavy woven fabric that can be made waterproof by coating it with wax</li><li>Strips of these duck cloth were used as tape, so the correct spelling for this term is indeed duck and not duct</li></ul></li><li>Nerfing<ul><li>Gaming term that means to tune down the ability or the mechanic of a character</li><li>It is a reference to the Nerf guns being the soft version of the actual thing</li></ul></li><li>Bone Dry Martini<ul><li>Gin in a chilled glass, sometimes washed with vermouth just to be discarded before pouring in the gin</li></ul></li><li>Ergodicity<ul><li>Long one</li><li>An ergodic system is when the average outcome of a cohort is the <strong>same</strong> as the average outcome of the individual over time<ul><li>For example, if there are 100 gamblers in a casino and they making bets with the odds that 1/100 gamblers will go bankrupt. But this means that, if gambler number 28 goes bust, it has no effect on gambler number 29. Using the standard cost-benefit analysis * this activity would have a good expected average return</li><li>However, if this is applied to a single person across 100 days with the same odds. This person can go bust on day 28 and have no money for future days.</li><li>This means that the ensemble probability can&#x27;t be applied to the time probability of a single individual * not an ergodic system!</li></ul></li><li>Usually, financial decisions <em>assume</em> ergodic system when in reality it is <em>actually</em> non-ergodic<ul><li>For example, a commonly used financial planning tool for retirement assumes a constant rate of return in investment. However, if you layer in the actual sequence of rate of return that average out to the constant rate on top of actual expenses * you could potentially be in a situation where you run out of money sooner than expected</li></ul></li><li>Relating to the idea from Nassim Taleb&#x27;s book [<!-- -->[Antifragile]<!-- -->], there is an idea that some things respond negatively to volatility while others respond positively.<ul><li>Things that respond positively are antifragile and also ergodic</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Abilene Paradox<ul><li>When the group makes a decision in contrary to all the individuals&#x27; preferences</li><li>Stems from thinking that others in the group would prefer something even though they personally don&#x27;t</li></ul></li><li>PF Chang, Haagen-Dazs<ul><li>Marketing tactic to give the audience an expectation for the product</li><li>The PF in PF Chang stands for Paul Fleming one of the two co-founders, the other is Philip Chiang<ul><li>But when the initials are used as the restaurant name it gives a less obvious hint to the non asian roots</li></ul></li><li>Haagen-Dazs was invented by the creators to &quot;sound Danish&quot;<ul><li>A tribute to their good treatment of Jews during WWII</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.beginnerwineguide.com/what-is-the-story-behind-that-rooster-on-the-neck-of-the-wine-bottle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chianti Rooster Legend</a><ul><li>Area between Florence and Siena in Italy that was under contention</li><li>After decades of battles, they decided to settle it once and for all by having their knights race to the boundary at the sound of a rooster&#x27;s crow</li><li>They picked their own roosters and the Florentines picked a black rooster that they starved for days</li><li>It croaked much earlier than sunrise, and their knight raced to only 20KM away from the Sienna walls</li></ul></li><li>Why is the glacier water blue<ul><li>Due to the minerals from the glacier <em> glacier flour </em> absorbing the short wavelengths and the water still absorbing the long wavelengths</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.space.com/light-pollution-loss-dark-skies-noctalgia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noctalgia</a><ul><li>Sky grief</li><li>A new term to describe the loss of the dark sky due to light pollution</li></ul></li><li>When pigs fly<ul><li>An adynaton, which is an hyperbole that is so extreme to imply the impossible</li><li>Other adynaton include:<ul><li>&quot;I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek&quot;</li><li>&quot;Not before Hell freezes over&quot;</li><li>&quot;When the Leafs win the Cup&quot; ;)</li></ul></li><li>There seems to be a trend of animal references (when cows fly, when hens grow teeth, when cow coughs, when a owl&#x27;s tail blooms, when donkeys fly, when fish climb poplar trees)</li></ul></li><li>Drunk bears in Montana<ol><li>There is a railroad near Glacier National Park where the trains sometimes spill grain and it gets fermented.
