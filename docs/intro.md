# Second Brain Intro

> My second brain for unforgetting the things I have learned

## Motivation

It is easy to learn new things and even easier to forget them. Without intentional repetition, it is difficult to recall code practices, useful snippets, tricky concepts when you need it. Without a system, it is impossible to perform this repetition.

This documentation space contains all the things I found useful or larger concepts I spent time learning. So when I need it again, it can serve as a quick reference for myself.

## Goals

:medal: This document should be *accessible*, maintaining high velocity for me to find the exact thing I need is the **primary** goal.

:medal::medal: The secondary goal is to serve as an overall archive for my continued learning.
