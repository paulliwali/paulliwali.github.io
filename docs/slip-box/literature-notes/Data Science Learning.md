    - [[fast-ai]] #course
        - A top down approach to teaching you advanced ML, should be done in conjunction with Andrew's [[Deep Learning AI]] course
        - 7/10
    - [[Big Data Specialization Degree]] #course
        - 4 full courses, will require a lot of commitment
        - 6/10
    - [[Machine Learning]] #course
        - Andrew Ng's introduction to ML class
	    - Source: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning#syllabus
        - I have completed the first 8 weeks of this, I never did the large scaled projects at the end
        - 8/10
    - [[Deep Learning AI]] #course
        - Advanced Andrew Ng's course on neural networks, picks up after his intro ML class [[Machine Learning]]
        - How does this differ from [[fast-ai]]?
            - fast-ai works from top-down while this course goes from bottom-up
            - fast-ai teaches the art of driving, while deep learning ai teaches you the engineering behind the car
        - 8/10
    - [[Data Science A-Z]] #course
        - Paid on Udemy, ranked highly
        - 21 hours of content, emphasizes on concepts instead of programming application because it is taught in gretl, tableau and excel instead of R or python
        - 9/10
    - [[Applied Data Science with Python Specialization]] #course
        - 5 courses, requires large dedication
        - Focused on teaching tools like pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, networkx to gain insights to data
        - 8/10

    - [[Deep Learning]] #books
	    - Source: https://www.deeplearningbook.org/front_matter.pdf
        - Heralded as the bible of machine learning, but it might be too rigorous to be useful for me at this moment
        - 3/10
    - [[Hands On Machine Learning]] #books 
        - O'reilly book with notebooks on Github, pretty good reviews
        - Good for hands on machine learning techniques, it has lots of project based teaching
        - Part I focus on machine learning techniques, Part II focus on neural networks with tensorflow
