- Anomaly detection is important to any data analytics application
    - Able to keep track of anomalies is crucial to ensure unintended positive or negative effects are removed
    - **anomalies** are outliers in data point that does not follow the __collective common pattern__ of the majority of the data points and hence can be easily identified
    - **time series anomaly** is a data point that doesn't follow the collective tread or seasonal or cyclic pattern of the entire data and is __significantly__ distinct
- Ways to detect anomaly in time series
    - 1. Predictive confidence level approach
    - 2. Statistical profiling approach
    - 3. Clustering based unsupervised approach
- Predictive confidence level approach
    - Build a model using historical data to estimate the overall trend, seasonal or cyclic pattern of the time series data
    - Forecast future values and based on error rates, we can come up with confidence interval or confidence band for the predicted values and *any observed data points which is falling beyond this confidence band is an anomaly*
    - Advantages of this approach is finding local outlier
    - Disadvantages of this approach is it relies on the efficiency of the predictive model
- Statistical profiling approach
    - Fast and useful while producing a controlled and explainable outcome
    - Calculating statistical values like mean or median moving average of the historical data and using a standard deviation to come up with a band of statistical values which can define the upper and lower bound
    - **Good baseline model**
    - __Disadvantage is detecting local outliers__
- Clustering based unsupervised approach
    - Does not require you to label the data, useful for when there are unknown outliers
    - Disadvantage is that it requires lots of tinkering with the cluster sizes and hard to dynamically estimate the cluster number for each series
        - Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)
        - Easy to tune, and does not group all data points to a cluster
        - Helps to map the new normal which most other approaches may fail
