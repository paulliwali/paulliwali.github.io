- General 
    - Training a dog is also training yourself, to be successful, you are always aware of what you are doing and how she is responding to it
    - Positive reinforcement above anything else
        - Change the situation such that you can reward her for doing something right __instead of__ punishing her for doing something wrong
        - Break the desired behavior into chunks and reinforce each step slowly and repeatedly
    - Never respond to her whining or barking for something
        - Instead - respond __immediately after__ a desirable action whether it is of her own volition or you gave her a command that she followed
    - Be consistent with rules and behaviors
        - It is always easier to be strict and slowly loosen as you go, but be consistent - don't flip flop between allowing and disallowing certain actions
    - Interactions with people
        - Try to discourage jumping on people for pets
        - Will get excited easily by people 
    - Interactions with dogs
        - Nobo will want to play with most dogs, and be very excited to sniff them. Sometimes her over excitement might scare other dogs AND Nobo will also try to stand and potentially bark for attention
        - I found that when Nobo needs to poop, she will also be anxious around other dogs and will bark more than normal
        - I still don't know what causes her to bark sometimes at dogs...but when it happens and I try to silently discourage by turning her away from the dog and walk a different direction
        - When playing with larger dogs, she might get "bullied" and will yelp at times, if you think Nobo is __not__ having a good time - try to **silently** remove her from the action - **don't freak out over the situation because it will cause her to also freak out**
- Daily Schedule
    - 0630: wake up
    - 0700 - 0730: morning walk, dog park. Nobo will poop 1x or 2x depending on the day. If she poops once, there is a chance for a midday poop if she goes for a long-ish walk
    - 745: breakfast (1 cup of dry food + 1 cup of wet food)
    - 1000 - 1200: random activities, will take her out for a potty break
    - 1500 - 1600: random activities, will take her our for a potty break
    - 1730: dinner (1 cup of dry food + 1 cup of wet food)
    - 1730 - 1830: evening walk, field to run in. Nobo will poop after eating dinner. Bring lots of water, she will drink and pee during her evening play if she runs around a lot.
    - 2000: one last potty and cut off her water 
    - 2100: crate for sleep
    - > Random activities includes fetch, teaching tricks, doing old tricks, petting, brushing. Can feed her treats or let her lick peanut butter or chew on sticks. 
    - > The times can be shifted if you keep her up later into the night

        - Selfie [Sit infront of her] - she should jump onto your shoulder
        - Bang []
    - Commands
        - ==All commands should be used wisely. Try to say it only once and when she is paying attention or she learns to ignore your commands. Try to say it when you have some confidence that she can actually do the command - set her up for success. Positive reinforcement for commands needs to happen __immediately__ following the command or you are rewarding something else==

        - Crate [Left hand form L-shape]
        - Bed - new-ish, she is suppose to go to her bed
