- Summary:
- Notes:
    - Stock is down 30% and laid off 25% of their staff
    - Their home value estimation models were not producing the results as expected
        - They started using it for buying and flipping homes
        - Zillow was going to buy homes and flip them for profit, but this relied on a very robust model that can accurately predict house prices in 6 months
    - It also relied on a linear increase in house values which doesn't happen in short term
    - **Stability** is a key assumption for statistical models, and that's not a given in complex systems like the housing market
        - The training data's distributions have distributions
        - Topology and Differential Geometry is important
        - __Distribution of distributions can be modeled as deformations in the inference space__
        - Why overfitting creates miraculous accuracy
        - **Models needs to learn about deformations by having training data from disconnected sources to the outcome**
    - To figure out the relationships between these features and the outcome requires experimentation and a chain of models
        - [[Causal Inference]]
        - Deep learning models
            - Throw all the features at it and let it figure it out
    - Large production model architectures are expensive and time consuming to set up
        - Feature stores need to recommend features which could improve model accuracy
        - Experiment management system need to be able to track different experiments
        - Review is difficult
    - Tips for Data Scientists
        - When revenue starts getting booked against ML projects - **model reliability is critical**
