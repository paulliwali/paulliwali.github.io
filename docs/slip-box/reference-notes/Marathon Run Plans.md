There are is a treasure trove of different plans, see: https://fellrnr.com/wiki/A_Comparison_of_Marathon_Training_Plans. I am not sure which is best for me, I was drawn to the 80/20 plan which focuses on long slow runs and FIRST plan which has less runs and uses hybrid training. 

However, it doesn't seem like those are good free options so I am going to try the COROS 12-week half marathon plan to get a good base going and then use Runner's World Training plan https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/marathon/a760131/rws-ultimate-marathon-schedule-sub-400/ which has some long runs and speed work.

## COROS 12-week plan
- A zone-2 based plan that has decent weekly volume 15-30 miles
- Sprinkled with some speed work
