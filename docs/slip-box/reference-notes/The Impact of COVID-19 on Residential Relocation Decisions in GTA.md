- Life Style <-> Long-term decision (location choice) <-> Mid-term decision (car ownership) <-> Short-term decision (daily travel)
    - COVID created unprecedented short-term behavior
- Designed a study to assess the different layers of decisions 
    - What happens to those who already had plans to relocate
    - What happens to those who had no issues with their residence
    - Also, how are households behaving in the new emerging market
- In a stable market, utility maximizing theory seems reasonable; in an unstable market, does utility maximizing still hold?
    - **Secretary problem solvers** might be more applicable?
        - Once you interview a person, you have to make the decision, once you wait the market will change
- Stated Preference Design
    - **Attributes**
        - Dwelling type, region, price, area, tenure type, neighbourhood, access to public transit, access to highway, parking availability, walk access to school, office hours, telecommuting option
    - **Conditions**
        - Ask the scenario in 3 different conditions
        - COVID is no longer considered a thread due to vaccine
        - COVID is a new normal
        - COVID creates a second wave and we go into shutdown
    - **Scenario Design**
        - See the independent affect of each attribute, but that requires a huge sample size
        - Takes synthetic variance and covariance matrix and minimize it so it approaches independence for the attributes
    - **Sample**
        - From early July to late July
        - 75% response rate
        - Sample distribution is closely matching the population distribution
- Findings
    - Factors that affect long-term choice before the pandemic and after pandemic shifted such that proximity to services and stores is no longer importnat
    - No trends in relocation was found
- Conclusions
    - Based on this study, COVID seems to be a sudden shock in the system and not a long term effect
