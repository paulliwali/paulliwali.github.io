# 📰 Summary (use your own words)


# ✍️ Notes
- The recursive loop of innovation
	- Create phenomenal wealth, price of labor that the technology replaced will fall to 0
	- World change so rapidly and drastically that an equally drastic change in policy will be needed to distribute wealth
	- Improve standard of living for people more than ever
- We are at the start of this tectonic shift and can pivot into the direction we wish to head towards
- AI revolution
	- The coming change will center around our abilities to think, create, understand and reason
	- Progress made will be exponential
- Moore's law for everything
	- Two ways to afford a good life, increase wealth or decrease price
	- To effectively increase society wealth, the best way is to decrease the cost of goods
	- We will discover new jobs - we always do after a technology revolution
	> #opinion Just because historically this has always happened doesn't mean it will hold if we don't know the root cause
- Capitalism for Everyone
	- Stable economy requires growth and inclusivity
	- In a zero-sum world, democracy can become antagonistic as people will want to vote money away from each other and leads to distrust and polarization
	- In a high-growth world, dogfights can be far fewer because its much easier for everyone to win
	- **The price of progress in capitalism is inequality**
		- Some inequality is okay, even critical to the operation of the system
	- Tax should shift from income to capital
	> Hard for me to imagine to have this shift practically put into place
	
	- The tax becomes "American Equity Fund" and distributed to all adults
	- People are incentivized to improve the country as their fund gets bigger
	> Also questionable conclusion, given that people in companies are somewhat incentivized by owning shares. However, how much day to day decisions are made with that in mind?
- Shifting to the New System
	- Good future envisioned here is __simple__. Technology to create more wealth, policy to fairly distribute it
