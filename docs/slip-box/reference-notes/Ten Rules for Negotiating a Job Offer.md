# üì∞ Summary (use your own words)
Actionable advice on salary negotiations. Embrace the negotiating mindset. Don't think you are being difficult because it is a important part of the process.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Notes
- You should always negotiate and you won't damage a relationship by negotiating
- Get everything in writing
	- Write notes for all the different offers/perks they have mentioned to refer back to when getting the final offer on paper
- Always keep the door open
	- The recruiter will give details and ask "what do you think?"
	- Your job is to not give up negotiating power *until you are ready to make an informed, deliberate final decision*
	- Their favourite thing to hear is "yes, when do I start" followed by "instead of x can we do y?"
- Information is power
	- The company is not giving you insights into how they are thinking, and you only have negotiating power *because they don't have information on you*
	- Instead say something along the lines of "Yeah! This is a great opportunity and I think I would be a great fit. Right now I'm talking with a few other companies so I can't speak to the specific details of the offer until I'm done with the process and get closer to making a decision. But I'm sure we can reach a mutually satisfactory stage because I really would love to be part of this team"
- Always be positive
	- Be unequivocally positive!
	- Your excitement is one of the most valuable assets, always give them the impression that you are interested in the company and you are still excited to work there
- Don't be the decision maker
	- Wrap up the convo with something like "Thank you, and I will look over the details with a significant other and I'll reach out if I have any questions and be in touch"
- Have alternatives
	- By roping in other people, you are now not the only decision maker they have to convince
	- It is a classic customer support technique because it is no longer their decision to make
	- Proactively reach out to any other companies that you are in the pipelines with to let them know you have alternative offers in hand
	- **Demand breeds demand**
	- Timing is important, try to keep as many overlapping offers as possibly and start with larger companies first because they are slower
- Proclaim reasons for everything
	- Make them feel that they *have* a reason for complying with your demand as opposed to just "because"
- Be motivated by more than just money
	- When you are motivated by other things, you might end up with more money
	- Ask about other dimensions - what training will you get, what is my first project, who my mentor will be
	- Also salary is usually the hardest thing to move but think about other things you can ask for
- Final decision
	- Make it a business day
	- Give it a clear deadline so everyone in the party knows
	- Final trump card is "as you know, I am planning to do this and if you can give me this I will sign"
