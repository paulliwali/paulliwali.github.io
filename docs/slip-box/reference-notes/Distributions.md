Median - the point where 50% of the data is above and below it
Mean - the expected value of the data
Variance - the spread of data; calculated like MSE but against the mean
Standard Deviation - the measure of spread in the data; calculated by the square root of the mean squared difference of data and the mean. Like RMSE except it is against the mean.
Standard Error - estimates the standard deviation of an estimate, which itself measures how much the estimate depends on the particular sample that was taken from the population.; calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of samples
Sigma - A normal distribution has 68% of the data within 1 standard deviation

Normal Distribution

Binomial Distributions

Law of large numbers
- The LLN is used to ensure that empirical averages computed from large samples are good estimates of the population mean

Central limit theorem
- enables the assumption of normally distributed data from a large sample even if the population is not normally distributed
