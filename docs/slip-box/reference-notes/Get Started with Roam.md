- Daily Notes
    - Every day, there is a default note being created
    - In October 2020, I implemented a daily log template for the daily notes for better organization and helps to facilitate some actionable notes
- Graph Overview
    - All your notes connected together
- All Pages
    - All your notes listed
- Shortcuts
    - Add your favorites notes here
- Note components
    - Page
        - Each note resides on a page, and can be interconnected by referencing it with `[[]]` or `#` or `::`
        - The difference being that `#` only supports notes with a single word
    - Block
        - Each point is a block, and can be interconnected between notes by referencing it with `(())`
    - Typical markdown support with LaTeX math
    - If you click on the bullet of the block, you can open it up to edit on its own
    - ==To highlight== use `cmd+h`
    - To embed images use ![image] (url), for example ![yosemite](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498429089284-41f8cf3ffd39?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2850&q=80)
    - Or I can upload an image by using the backslash and upload from computer
- Edit themes by adding code to [[roam/css]]
