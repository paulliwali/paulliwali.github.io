- Data Preparation
    - **Split training and testing** to avoid overfitting of the model the training data
- Model Evaluation
    - **Norms is a linear algebra concept that measure how big is a tensor/matrix/vector**
        - Commonly used to evaluate regression type models
        - Mean squared error
        - Mean absolute error
    - ==However, high variance can lead to high MSE but not necessarily a good model==
        - Coefficient of determination (R squared)
