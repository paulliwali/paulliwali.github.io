- My initial impressions
    - It is close to urban centre so everywhere should be walkable and billable
    - The roads are tighter which makes driving slightly less appealing
    - The apartment is relatively new which usually means good amenities
    - The gym looked very busy, not sure if there is a squat rack inside
