Logarithmic transformation
- Use the logarithmic operation to compress the range of values and reduce skewness
- Log is essentially finding what the power is needed for the base to obtain the input
- Base 2: $log_2(X)=Y$ is finding what should $Y$ be such that $2^Y=X$, so $log_2(8)=3$ because $2^3=8$
- Base 10: $log_{10}(X)=Y$ is finding what should $Y$ be such that $10^Y=X$
- Base e or natural log: $ln(X)=Y$ is finding what Y be such that $e^Y=X$

Square Root Transformation
- This technique reduces the range of values by taking the square root of each value. It is useful for stabilizing variance.

Box-Cox Transformation
- A family of power transformation
