📖 Short Summary (1 takeaway)
- A school of philosophy that has real-world applications for the modern life

🧐 Why I am reading this book
- Founded by Zeno of Citium in early third century BC
    - He would teach from the porch which in Greek is __stoa__
    - **Asserts that virtue is happiness, and it is our perception of things - rather than the things themselves - that cause most of our trouble**
- This school of philosophy was made more practical by the likes of Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and Seneca who all used stoicism to help them with answering questions that bother all of us
    - Framed their work around three disciplines: perception, action, will
