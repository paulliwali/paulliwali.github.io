📖 Short Summary (1 takeaway)
- Simple scifi about a simple self-replicating AI trying to help humanity survive the collapse of Earth. Did not finish because I felt that the challenges the protagonist faced where random and his solutions were equally random. Was not rooted in hard-core science.

🧐 Why I am reading this book
- Was recommended by a friend after talking about our love for science fiction books
