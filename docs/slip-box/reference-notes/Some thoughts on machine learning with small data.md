- Summary: Techniques for making machine learning work with small data is not discussed upon because companies usually boast about large data-sets. However, lots of the time there are only limited amount of data available
	- Metalearning techniques are useful here to train on __adjacent problems__
		- Few-shot learning, transfer learning and multi-task learning
		- Augmenting data or create synthetic data

	- Inject domain knowledge by determining constraints like monotonically, convexity, and pairwise trust into the model directly
		- Your assumption has to be accurate and holds up over time
