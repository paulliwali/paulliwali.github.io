### North Circle Loop

*   **Mileage**: 52 miles, can vary depending on itinerary
    
*   **Days Needed:** 5-7
    
*   **Trailhead:** [Iceberg-Ptarmigan Trailhead](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Iceberg+Ptarmigan+Trailhead/@48.7998888,-113.6775952,17.52z/data=!4m13!1m5!2m4!1sptarmigan+wall+trailhead!5m2!5m1!1s2018-10-28!3m6!1s0x5368b20c283fe125:0x3ba533a17933d096!5m1!1s2018-10-28!8m2!3d48.7995359!4d-113.6773919) (Many Glacier area)
    

Although there are several variations of this trip, the North Circle Loop we discuss begins and ends in the Many Glacier area. If heading in a counterclockwise direction you’ll first head north on the Ptarmigan Trail, eventually heading west towards Stoney Indian Pass, and Fifty Mountain Trail before heading south on part of the CDT. You’ll stay on the CDT until you reach the Granite Park Chalet and then swing east on the Swiftcurrent Trail towards Many Glacier. If you want to add for miles (and beauty!), you can do a lollipop loop and add a trip along the Highline Trail. The best way to do this would be to begin and end your hike at the Highline Trailhead at L[ogan Pass.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Logan+Pass+Visitor+Center/@48.6963734,-113.7203715,17z/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x5368af512bf83b1f:0x64cdf1479b75bbbd!5m1!1s2018-10-28!8m2!3d48.6953271!4d-113.7180487)

Another option is to complete this loop and then head north towards Goat Haunt. If you’re planing on continuing on to Waterton from Goat Haunt, don’t forget your passport.

It’s important to note that backcountry travel in this part of the park is one of the most sought-after itineraries. Furthermore, you’ll need patience as you encounter many day hikers heading toward the ptarmigan tunnel, which provides passage to the other side of the Ptarmigan Wall. But once through backpackers emerge to sweeping vistas of glacial carved valleys, pristine lakes and dense forests, and, more important, relative solitude.

### Permitting Locations

According to NPS, there are 5 different locations where you can obtain a walk-in backcountry permit, some more busy than others. Generally, all backcountry permitting office open at 7 am, but we recommend checking with each office as this can change from season to season. The Waterton Lakes National Parks Visitor Center had issued permits in the past, but due to catastrophic fires in 2017 and the subsequent destruction of the Waterton Visitor Centre, Waterton Lakes National Park will not be issuing backcountry permits for Glacier National Park in 2018. This could change in the future, so check back for updates. Below are the permitting offices in GNP:
