- Support vectors are margins added around the decision boundary to allow the model to __feel__ the data
- Soft margin
    - allows for instances to be within the margins
    - most common type of SVM
- Hard margin
    - no instances are allowed to be within the margins
- The width of the margins are typically denoted with $$\epsilon$$
- The construction of the error function is to ensure __flatness__ by minimizing the coefficients to ensure there are no overfitting **and** minimize the residual error to be less than the margin width $$\epsilon$$
    - The model may not exist to satisfy the hard margin condition, leading to a surrogate function using slack variables which is the soft margin condition
    - Solving this problem involves [[Quadratic Programming]]
