* A framework for thinking developed by Paul Saffo
- Enables us to make decisions or forecasts with incomplete information
- Start with a tentative hypothesis, find evidence that either supports it or refutes, **if you find evidence that refutes it - change your hypothesis**
- The fastest way to a good forecast is through a series of lousy forecasts
	- Make tentative forecasts based on existing data and systematically tear it apart
- Strong opinion
	- Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion
- Weakly held
	- Prove yourself wrong with evidence
	- Engage in creative doubt by **actively search for counter evidence**
- Inherent biases that impact our thinking 
	- Law of small numbers
		- We are drawn to small anecdotal example over statistically significant data
	- Confirmation bias
		- We favour evidence that confirms our existing perspective and dismiss contradictory evidence
	- Over-optimism bias
		- We tend to come up with plans and forecasts that are unrealistically close to the best-case scenario
	- Assigning cause to random chance
		- We are quick to assign causality to events that may in fact be unconnected
	- Recency bias
		- We bias towards recent events when making decisions
