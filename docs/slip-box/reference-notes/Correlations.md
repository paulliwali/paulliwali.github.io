- Covariance
	- the joint variability of two random variables
	- calculated by $\frac{\Sigma(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{N-1}$
		- which is kind of like MSE/variance calculation but on two variables instead of squaring it
	- if the covariance is positive and large, then the two variables tend to have a linear relationship
	- if the covariance is 0 then they are not correlated
- Pearson's correlation coefficient
	- essentially a normalized measurement of covariance
	- calculated by the covariance divided by the product of the variables' standard deviations
	- thus the value will range from -1 to 1
	- where 1 or -1 is perfectly linearly correlated and 0 is not
