Classification
- Accuracy: the TP and TN ratio over all prediction
- Precision: of the model's predictions how many were TP
- Recall: of all the positives how many did the model predict correctly
- F1: harmonic mean between precision and recall
- ROC curve: plots the TP rate vs FP rate and the bigger area is used 

Regression
- R squared: percentage of variability of dataset that can be explained
	- 1 - (SSR / SST)
	- SSR: sum of squared residual
	- SST: standard deviation squared
- Mean squared error: often used by the model as the cost function and gives weight to larger errors
- Root mean squared error: a more intuitive version of mean squared error because of the units 
- Mean absolute error: very intuitive to understand 
- Mean absolute percent error: gives context to the mean absolute error
