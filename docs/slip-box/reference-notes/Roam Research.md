- Why Roam?
    - Roam Research is a popular tool for people to store knowledge by creating notes as individual nodes and interconnect them via a mind map
    - The advantage of this format is in its ability to enable the user to dig deeper and deeper into topics while keeping track of how they relate to each other
    - Builds [[meta-cognition]]
- Roam's structure
    - The final product is a dynamic relational database that grows and shifts with the user's interest
    - Every point in the notes is a block, which can be referenced individually
    - Blank notes/nodes can be created for later
        - For example, Roam's structure
