- Instead of measuring your life in units of time, you can measure it by events or activities
    - How many winters
    - How many Superbowl
    - How many books to read
    - How many US presidential elections
    - How many Chinese food for dinners
- However, these things have a relatively stable rate but there are things that are very unequally spread out in one's life
    - Time with parents - once you graduate from high school, you have used up 93% of in-person parent time - **we are in the tail end**
    - Time with siblings, friends, etc
- Takeaways
    - Living in the same place as the people you love matters
    - Priorities matter - make sure the list of people you spend time with is created by you
    - Quality time matters - keep the fact that you are in the tail end in your mind when you are with them and treat this time as precious as anything else
