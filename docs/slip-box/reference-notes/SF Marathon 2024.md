# Run Plans
- There are is a treasure trove of different plans, see: https://fellrnr.com/wiki/A_Comparison_of_Marathon_Training_Plans
- I am not sure which is best for me, I was drawn to the 80/20 plan which focuses on long slow runs and FIRST plan which has less runs and uses hybrid training. 
- However, it doesn't seem like those are good free options so I am going to try the COROS 12-week half marathon plan to get a good base going and then use Runner's World Training plan https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/marathon/a760131/rws-ultimate-marathon-schedule-sub-400/ which has some long runs and speed work.

## COROS 12-week plan
- A zone-2 based plan that has decent weekly volume 15-30 miles
- Sprinkled with some speed work

# Retrospective
- Given the preparation, I was aiming to finish at around 5:30 which is 12.6 min/mile or 7.8 min/km pace 
	- My longest prep run was 18 miles which I finished in ~4 hours with mild cramping in the thighs that went away after a while
- My dad pushed for a 4:30 finish which is a 10.3 min/mile or 6.4 min/km pace
	- Thought that my goals were conservative and should go out of the comfort zone more and push the limits
- Turns out - it was too fast
	- Heart rate was consistently at around 180-190 BPM for the first 10 miles 
	- Maintained the 10.5 min/mile pace until the bridge return at mile 13
	- That's when my thighs started to really cramp up and I was trying my best to shake it off
- I stuck to a good refueling and hydration plan
	- Ate a gel every 45 minutes and eventually moved onto gummy candy
	- The 1.5L of water I carried was finished around mile 16 at Richmond area
- From mile 15 to 17 it was very miserable with the ups and downs
	- I added a new piece of muscle to my cramp on every hill and they *had to be walked*
	- This is also when the first half marathon finished so it is a mental hurdle to also get past the fact that you are only half way through 
- The city section was boring but running on the street is kind of good with lots of room to maneuver but at this point I was only really just mentally trying to keep going whenever possible and not stopping
	- My legs were completely shot with permanent cramping from calf up to the groin
	- Downhills and uphills are difficult
	- My dad talking to me about how much distance is left also didn't help
- After the final downhill and once we were beside the water I couldn't even keep a 13 minute pace anymore and had to stop to walk once in a while
	- The finish was super tough and I felt horrible
	- Legs were wobbly
	- Stomach was churning
	- Muscle pain everywhere
	- Breathing felt actually ok
- The immediate hours after the marathon was just lots of soreness in the thighs and calves. Stepping up and down was basically impossible. This become bearable after 48 hours
