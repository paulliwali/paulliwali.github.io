19. Does reading or playing video games lead to near-sightedness?
	- I've always been told by my parents that reading or playing video games can lead to near-sightedness or myopia
	- Recent studies have shown correlation between lack of outdoor play and natural light exposure with increased risk of myopia as an adult - https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7973740/
	- Which might have been the underlying reason for reading being linked to near-sightedness
20. Liar's Poker

	- It is similar to "Liar's dice", except the numbers are generated by the serial numbers on the US one-dollar bills
21. Markov Chains
	- Law of large numbers: Average outcome gets closer to expected numbers with independent events 
		- This was only proved for independent events, so all of probability relied on this independence assumption as well, until Andrey Markov 
	- Andrey Markov (socialist, atheist) and Pavel Nekrasov (tsar, religious) argued whether mathematics can explain will of god and free will
		- Nekrasov: if you see the LLN then there must be independent events
			- Used Belgian Marriage dataset and other social statistics to argue that because we see convergence of statistics which is observing the LLN then the decisions causing such social events (marriage, crimes, etc) *must be independent*
			- Free will, thus, can be *measured*
		- Markov: set out to prove dependent events can also follow the LLN
			- Used a poem to train a text prediction model and found that the probability of two letters that followed VV, CC, VC, or CV case occurred differently than if you computed their expected average *assuming independence* which is $P(C/V) \times P(C/V) != P(actual VV/CC/CV/VC)$ 
			- Built a model to make this dependent event prediction which is "markov chain" and showed that it can *follow the LLN as well*
			- "Free will is not necessary to do probability" - Markov proved that observing LLN statistics does not mean independent events thereby showing that LLN can be true for dependent events as well

24. Shibboleth
	- Like a password that indicates you are part of a distinct group, usually a phrase or a word

	- Related to this is also the trending term "6-7"
25. 6-7
	- A term that is almost shibboleth for gen-z/alpha to distinguish those "in the know"
		- It evolved from calling it out when 67 happens naturally in a conversation to acknowledging it without actually saying the phrase
	- It has gone through "semantic bleaching" and lost its original meaning to the point that when Googling it, it refers to either a high crime street in Chicago or the height of Lamelo Ball as he endorsed popular video edits of his highlights

	- Newton hypothesis is that advancements are made by a few great scientists
	- Ironic thing is that it is named after Jose Ortega y Gasset who wrote in "The Revolt of the Masses" that astoundingly mediocre men of narrow specialties do most of the work of experimental science and he believed that progress is made by geniuses building on each other's work
	- Neither hypothesis have been definitively proven wrong
