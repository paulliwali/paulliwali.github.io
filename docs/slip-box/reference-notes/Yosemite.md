- Sunrise Trail via Tenaya Lake to Cloud's Rest
    - The best view of half-dome
    - A medium 6-10 hour hike with some decent elevation gain
    - The trail leads to Half Dome where it is probably a good idea to setup camp somewhere in the middle
    - There is another trail head from the valley that can take you to some waterfalls
- Panorama Trail from Glacier Point
    - Went about 2.5 miles into the trail to a bridge with a nice pool of water where you can swim
    - The trail is all descent or ascent
    - Easy trail that took 2-ish hours for the 5 miles in and out
