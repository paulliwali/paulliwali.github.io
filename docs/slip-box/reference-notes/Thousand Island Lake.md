# Log
Day 0
- Drove from SF to [Travertine Hot Springs](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WHYipiQ4DTCJbGi77) in Bridgeport through Modesto and Stanislaus National Forest
- Dispersed camping was available just before the hot springs after the offshoot road, but car camped right beside the spring overnight
- The temperature got to around 0C but was comfortable in the car, it is a little short for me and my head was falling through the cracks
Day 1
- The hot spring was pretty warm and there are four more springs further down the trail with 1 being really hot and the other 3 is temperate
- Drove to Mono Lake to have breakfast and saw the partial solar eclipse 
- Drove to trailhead and started the hike at 11am
- Took about 6 hours to get to campsite with the incline and first time backpacking for [[h]]
- Campsite is dispersed area around the Lake with rocks and some soft soil
- No washrooms or bear lockers
Day 2
- Return trip was easier but took around the same time as the entry trip

# Retrospective
- Will definitely do again and can go on a longer route
