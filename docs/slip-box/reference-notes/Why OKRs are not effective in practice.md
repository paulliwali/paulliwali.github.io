* They don't take enough of the leader's time
	- OKRs should be tightly integrated between individuals, teams, groups and company
	- Leaders should spend most of the time setting goals and measurements, instead of on execution
- The process starts too late and takes too long
	- This becomes a death spiral with project deadlines
- OKRs aren't fully committed to
	- You might be already working on something that is not aligned with OKRs and convince yourself that is also very important
- There are no real consequences for failing OKRs
	- Just write new OKRs or push them to the next quarter
	- ==Goals should be the last thing you consider, identify the high levels of the stack clearly articulated such that the goals make sense and measure progress towards a strategic outcome==
- Strategy is the overarching direction the company is moving towards, they are **not goals**
	- Mission -> Company Strategy -> Product Strategy -> Product Roadmap -> Product Goals
