- Web 1 was decentralized, Web 2 is centralized, and Web 3 will be decentralized __but with the richness of Web 2__
	- Why did we centralize everything? People don't want to run servers, protocols are hard to be agreed upon but platforms can be improved quickly
- Distribution of Web 3 relies on the fact that the states and logic of the site is on a blockchain instead of a centralized database
	- The idea is good but in practice it can't reach the promise of complete decentralization
