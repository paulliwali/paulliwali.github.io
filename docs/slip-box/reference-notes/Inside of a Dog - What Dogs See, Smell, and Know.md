🙊 Great quotes
> Many dog owners who dress their dogs in coats have the best intentions: they have noticed, perhaps, that their dog resists going outside when it rains. It seems reasonable to extrapolate from that observation to the conclusion that he dislikes the rain. The be-jacketed dog may cooperate in going out, but not because he has shown he likes the coat; it is because he has been subdued. #quotes
