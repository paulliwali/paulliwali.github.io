- Summary:
    - GOT failed in the end because it shifted its rare sociological way of telling its story into a psychological one - dominated by hero's/anti-hero's' internal motivations and not something bred out of the society that it is in
- Notes:
    - The mainly talked about reasons for why the show declined in quality were
        - New and inferior writers
        - Shortened season
        - Lack of source material
        - Too many plot holes
    - Fundamental issue is actually a ==shortcoming of our storytelling culture - we don't really know how to tell sociological stories==
    - When GOT was at its best, the show was a **sociological **and **institutional **storytelling in a medium dominated by the **psychological **and the **individual**
        - Sociological vs psychological
        - Institutional vs individual
    - George R. R. Martin was adept at creating characters that seems to be molded by the institution and evolves in response to the broader setting
    - When David Benioff and D. B. Weiss ran out of source material they steered the narrative thread to a more psychological and typical style popular in Hollywood
        - This type of writing is common because it is the most natural way of telling a story
    - However, the narrative change was not the sole problem because despite changing the style D&D was also not good at the new style
        - plot holes
        - convenient plot devices (Arya ex machina)
    - The pull of GOT was the fact that ==the story can kill major characters without losing the thread of the story==
        - There is no singular powerful main character to build around
        - No single narrative 
    - In sociological storytelling, each character has their own personal agency but they are entangled in the world of webs that also affects their choices and growth
    - > "Should you kill baby Hitler?" is not a true dilemma because a different demagogue would have taken his place in between the two bloody world wars because the society would have pushed for one
    - Fundamental attribution error is a [[Cognitive Bias]] where we assign too much importance to the individual as the locus of agency and that also plays a role to why Hollywood tend to produce stories which are individual based
    - Hallmark of sociological storytelling is ==if it can encourage us to put ourselves in the place of __any__ character and imagine us making similar choices==
        - Not just empathy, but actual understanding because we can justfiy the evil doers actions
    - A similar show in this vain is The Wire
    - If told correctly, Daenerys' descent into madness would have been a strong and riveting story
        - However, it became ridiculous because her actions were indefensible 
        - They kept the story but not the story telling method
    - The psychological and internal genre leaves us unable to understand and react to social change
