- ==Modelers much not be permitted to project more certainty than their models deserve; politicians must not be allowed to offload accountability to models of their choosing==
- Mind the assumption
    - Models are often imported from other applications, where the assumptions made are no longer reasonable
    - Require inputs that cant be known for the scenario
    - Global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis should be done to potentially mitigate this
- Mind the hubris
    - ==Complexity does not equate to accuracy==
    - More parameters means more uncertainty due to the uncertainty cascade effect
- Mind the framing
    - Model will contain biases from the developers
    - The tool can be easily manipulated by the developers to support or decline a certain point of view
- Mind the consequences
    - The need to produce numbers can **push a discipline away from being roughly right towards being precisely wrong**
- Mind the unknowns
    - Docta ignorantia is a virtue
    - Models can mask or hide ignorance
    - Failure to acknowledge this fact can lead to undesired surprises
