At work, there are countless design documents and proposals but they are often derailed due to turgid prose.
Here are some tips for better writing:
1. The voice in your head is an unreliable narrator, if you read what you just wrote you can convince yourself easily that what you wrote down is what you want to say - instead of showing you what the text is actually spelling out
2. Have a crisp tagline and test every sentence in the doc against it
3. Write for your audience, not for yourself
4. You are competing for attention, so short sentences and short words 

Escalations and disputes, it is important to identify **the most tractable causes and putting forward the right choices**.

Arguments, it is important to agree on the underlying facts.
