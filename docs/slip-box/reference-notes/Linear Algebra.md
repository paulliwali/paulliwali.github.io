Vectors
- Ordered list of numbers to represent points in space, directions or any other quantities that have magnitude and direction
- Addition of vectors is applied element wise and produces a vector of the same shape
- Scalar multiplication is applied element wise and produces a vector
- Dot product is sum product of the vectors and produces a scalar
- Cross product is the multiplication of direction and magnitude and produces a vector perpendicular to both
	- you have to multiply all coordinates and directions 

Matrices
- 2D vectors 
- Represent a system of linear equations, data tables or transformations
- Addition is applied element wise and produces a matrix of the same shape
- Scalar multiplication is applied element wise and you get a matrix of the same shape
- Matrix multiplication is applied vector wise and you get a matrix with a number of rows same as the first matrix and a number of columns the same as the second
- Transpose is to flip along the diagonal 
- Determinant is a scalar value and a property of a square matrix
	- For a 2x2 square matrix of (abcd) it is calculated like $ad - bc$ or
	- For a 3x3 square matrix of (abcdefghi) it is calculated like $a \times det(efhi) - b \times det(dfgi) + c \times det(degh)$
- Inverse matrix is one that $AA^-1=I$
	- The square matrix is invertible IFF the determinant is non-zero
