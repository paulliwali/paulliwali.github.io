Probability is the % chance of an event happening = P
Odds = P/(1-P)
	- relative likelihood of something happening, even odds would be 1
Log-odds = Log_e(odds) = Ln(odds)
- mathematically useful because it maps odds which goes from 0 to 1 to -inf to inf and symettrical around 0
- Different than log-loss, which is log of a the loss function and that gives special properties of 0 probability getting penalized and 1 probability getting 0 loss
