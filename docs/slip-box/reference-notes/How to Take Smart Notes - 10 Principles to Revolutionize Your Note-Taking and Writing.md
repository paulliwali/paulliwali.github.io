- [ ] Apply the 8 steps of taking smart notes
    1. Make fleeting notes
        - __I capture them in daily notes. But I should give better tags to them__
    2. Make literature notes
        - __Capture main points that I don‚Äôt want to forget in more formal notes__
    3. Make permanent notes
        - __I have yet to create any of these. Need to look at the first two kinds of notes and develop arguments sand discussions with them__
    4. Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box
    5. Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the slip-box
    6. Decide on a topic to write about from within the slip-box
    7. Turn your notes into a rough draft
    8. Edit and proofread your manuscript
- [ ] Apply the 10 most important principles
    - Writing is not the outcome of thinking; it is the medium in which thinking takes place
    - Do your work as if writing is the only thing that matters
    - Nobody ever starts from scratch
        - A damaging myth about creativity
    - Our tools and techniques are only as valuable as the workflow
        - Good system don‚Äôt add options and features; they strip away complexity and distractions from the main work - **thinking**
    - Standardization enables creativity
    - Our work only gets better when exposed to high-quality feedback
        - __I can really feel that right now with my work, getting PR approved by others and have to formulate why/how I am doing something is really challenging.__
    - Work on multiple, simultaneous projects
        - __I can relate to this. I think there is a sweet spot of just enough projects to get you to cross pollinate the ides but not too many that you are constantly distracted by something else__
    - Organize your notes by context, not by topic
        - Ask yourself, in what context will I need this again?
        - Maybe that should be a new metadata tag...‚Äùcontext‚Äù
        - Don‚Äôt think about where you should **store** the note, think about where you might need to **find** this again
    - ==Always follow the most interesting path==
    - Save contradictory ideas
        - Enemy of independent thinking is the inability to overcome confirmation bias and break our tendency to develop one-sided opinions
