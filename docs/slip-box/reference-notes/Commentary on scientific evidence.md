- ==Science should be based on a willingness to be wrong and an openness to new evidence==
- Poor science is not when it is wrong in its predictions, but when it claims an unwarranted level of certainty
- A fact is like a note, it is the same in different pieces of music but can act in very different roles and invoke different responses
    - ==Knowing the distribution and frequency of the note in a piece will also not tell you how the piece sounds==
