	* #data-science 
* #til2022 Baruch Plan
	* An international organization would be in control of all nuclear products
	* Russia rejected this plan and triggered the nuclear arms race
* #til2022 Peace Symbol 
	* Created with the combination of the semaphore letters of `N` and `D`, which stands for "nuclear disarmament"
* First developed to detect underground nuclear tests with seismometers
	* Now it is used in most compression algorithms and signal processing
* Fourier Transform decomposes any signal into the sum product of sine waves
	* This is done by taking a sine (and cosine) wave and multiplying it into the signal and if the area under the product is **non-zero** then the sine wave *is correlated* with the signal and a component
	* The size of the area is the relative amplitude of that sine wive
	* Sweep across all frequencies of the sine (and cosine) wave
* Discrete Fourier Transform is used for discrete finite data which is what the seismometers record
	* Requires a high number of calculations that scales with the number of samples $N^2$
* Fast Fourier Transform
	* Discovered by Tukey and implemented by Cooley
	* Scales with the number of samples $Nlog_2N$
* However, this wasn't discovered in time so lots of underground testing were done during the arms race because the comprehensive test ban could not be established
	* **But it was, Gauss figured out Fourier Transform and FFT before Fourier and Tukey but it wasn't published nor it was written in an easily accessible writing**
