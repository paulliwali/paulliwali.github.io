🙊 Great quotes
> May you return without harm, and may your travels never be entirely safe
> 
> If wishes were fishes, we’d all cast nets
> 
> I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will return the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

> 
> Hope clouds observation
> 
> It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.
> 
> The people who can destroy a thing, they control it.
> 
> Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.
