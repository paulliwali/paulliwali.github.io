- Proved "spooky action at a distance" is real
- **Locality** is a physics principle that says
	> An event in one part of the world cannot instantly affect what happens far away #til2021
	- It is a bedrock assumption about physics
- In 1935, Albert Einstein and two colleagues showed that quantum mechanics allows for **entanglement**
	- "spooky action at a distance"
- In 1964, John Stewart Bell demoted locality by proving quantum mechanics can prove outcomes of certain far-apart measurement than any local theory could
- How Bell's theorem showed entanglement is real
	- When two particles are entangled, measuring the properties of one particle affects the property of the other particle regardless of distance
	- Consider the property spin, which can be "up" or "down"
	- Bell's theorem said that the upper bound on the correlations allowed by local hidden variable theories is 67%
		- So if the experiment can break this inequality then something more than locality is the feature of these particles
