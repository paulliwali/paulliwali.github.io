- Framework
    - Long term and short term decisions create feedback loops
    - Model this complex process into a feasible set of choices
- Trip Based
    - 4-step model, each trip is a connection between an origin and destination
    - Typical purposes are HBW, HBS, HBO, NHB
    - Limitations of this approach
- Tour Based
    - Chain trips into tours
    - Lacks an integrated schedule pattern
    - Doesn't integrate with time (toll schedule, school schedule)
- Activity Based
    - Travel is derived from activities
    - Tours are independent
    - People face time and space constraint to limit their activities
    - Activity and travel decisions are made in context of the overall schedule
    - Activity pattern -> primary tours -> secondary tours
    - Limitation being that a large choice set can result in unrealistic behavior, and high computation requirement
