- Key feature of the double-hurdle model is that **there are two types of 0 observations: an individual can be of the zero type, and the outcome will always be zero; alternatively, the individual might not be a zero type, but his/her current circumstances might dictate that the outcome is zero**
- Applications
	- Cigarette consumption - some people will always be zero type and some other people might be zero because of circumstances
