Friday Night - camp at Lake Echo
Saturday - hike to Lake Aloha
Saturday night - camp around area 39 south of Lake Aloha near Lake America
Sunday - hike out 

The area is massive and lots of spaces to camp, we had a great spot by the lake that was swimmable
There were still snow along the trails and Nobo was going crazy on the icy patches
Need to hike the pyramid peak next time
