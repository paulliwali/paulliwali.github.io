# About
## Notes from founder letter 2021
- Internet was giving people the power to connect and that was true when Facebook was founded
- As we move from text to sound to video, the next platform of connecting people will be more immersive -> metaverse
	- The feeling of presence will be critical for all products
- This won't be done by just one company but collectively with creators and developers and it is meta's job to enable and accelerate this development
> We don't build service to make money; we make money to build better service
- Challenges from each chapter of development is unique - privacy and safety are at the forefront
	- Also needs to conform to rules and regulations while remaining accessible to people
		- Apps are free, ads model give business the best price, commerce tools are at cost or modest fees
- To build beyond Facebook
## Why work at Meta?
- Be part of a team that focus on building services to connect people instead of building products for people to connect to
- Part of a team that can impacts billions of people, work on connecting people from far and wide, the power of the "internet"
- I want to be impactful and work with talented people to continue to learn skills
