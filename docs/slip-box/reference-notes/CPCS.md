Canadian consulting firm that was initially created by CP, but then expanded out of that business to infrastructure. Alec along with many ex-WSP advisory people are working there now, lead by Adrian Lightstone.
Connecting with the Infrastructure Analytics team to learn about the types of projects they are working on and if it fits my current career goals. 


Meeting with Alec
- Very positive recommendation on my skill set
- Understands my priorities
- Ask me to meet with the lead at US to understand the team better

Meeting with Alex 
- Director of Freight (moving into more public transit projects)
- Pay is probably not competitive enough
- Interesting group in the US with 5 people (cartographers and analysts)
	- Looking to hire cartographers first and maybe when growing will hire another analyst
	- Invested in people growth
