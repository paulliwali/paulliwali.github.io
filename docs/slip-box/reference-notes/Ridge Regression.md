- L2 regularization (MSE)
- Works by adding this term $\alpha * |coefficients^2|$ in the cost function so we are penalizing the size of the coefficients
	- This will uniformly decrease the coefficients
	- The parameter $\alpha$ will control the shrinkage which makes the coefficients more robust to collinearity
- The alpha term can be found by using cross-validation techniques
	- `sklearn.linear_Regression.RidgeCV` uses leave-one-out-cross-validation technique to find the alpha that minimizes the cross-validated mean squared error
