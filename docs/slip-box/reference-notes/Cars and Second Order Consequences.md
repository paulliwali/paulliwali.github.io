- Global stock of cars in 2017 is around 1.1 billion, the two major shifts of [electric vehicle]([[electric-vehicle]]) and [autonomous driving]([[autonomous-cars]]) will eventually cycle into this stock
- Direct impact of these two shifts will have profound effects on oil production and traffic accidents
- **But what about second and third ordered effects?**
    - Then what....okay, then what?
- Second order effects of EV
    - Tobacco purchase at gas stations
        - Well over half of US's tobacco sales are from convenience stores
    - Highways are funded by gas taxes
    - Electricity consumption, off-peak scheduling
- Second order effects of autonomous driving
    - Costs from vehicle damage has a large economic effect
    - Removes the need to reserve land for parking
    - Increases road capacity
    - Removes jobs for drivers
    - Cheaper on-demand rides
    - This will change how cities are built, how downtown and suburbs will interact, how big-box retail and stores will be situated
