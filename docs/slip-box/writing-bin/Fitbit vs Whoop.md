# Goal
Using Whoop and Fitbit to monitor my sleep quality.

## Context
My friends and family first instinct is always "oh are you having trouble sleeping?"
It is not that I have trouble sleeping or anything, it is just that I want to optimize this aspect to the maximum. 
The importance of sleep is increasingly being understood as possibly the single most important factor in health.
Why wouldn't I want this to be optimized better than my monster-hunter charge blade build?

The focus of this monitoring is to see which device correlate with my personal experience better so I can start to trust its outputs. 

# Issues
Whoop sensors are less forgiving if its not worn properly ([[2022-12-14]] night where the number of hours slept is very different)

# Components
## Sleep length
* show time series of both

## Sleep quality
* show the difference in each section
