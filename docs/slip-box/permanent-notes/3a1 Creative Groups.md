How to get a group to think creatively? 
You want to enable two things: cognitive diversity and an idea-lab environment. 
Cognitive diversity happens when people in the group come in approaching the problem with a varied set of mental tools.
These mental tools are developed and shaped by their life experience, education backgrounds and work experience.
They are critical to not get narrow minded over a solution to a problem and get boxed in.
The idea lab environment is an idea proposed on [[What's our problem]] where the author came up with the antithesis to an echo-chamber.
Which is an environment where people can submit ideas like boxers into a tournament and compete against each other's ideas (boxers) to battle it out. 
With each successful bout, they move on to the next fighter and eventually the best idea should prevail. 
This environment promotes arguments and discussions but also ensures that the people who submits their ideas are respected by creating a separation between ideas and people.
