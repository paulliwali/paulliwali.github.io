- The idea of a productive environment in the modern office is the hustle and bustle of people with folders moving from one meeting room to the next, or people in suits and ties eating while answering phones and replying to emails, or having impromptu stand up meetings around the manager’s desk.
- These are the wrong indicators for productiveness, they are just signs of busyness and distracting environment that hinders one’s ability to create the space and time required to think critically and rationally
- Warren Buffet’s office is in Omaha because he wanted to retain his perspective on the big picture away from New York where irrelevant details and noise can blur his critical vision
    - He also doesn’t have a computer in his office where he mostly just reads and thinks
- The schedule of the modern work environment also tends to put group meetings in the mornings of people’s calendars but they are lower effort tasks and should be done after high effort tasks
