First we need to understand the natural mechanisms of sleep and then we can preserve the triggers and maximize their effects to naturally improve sleep.
The sleep-wake cycle is governed by cortisol, adenosine and melatonin.
By shifting the cortisol pulse earlier to the day, we can create a bigger sleep desire at the appropriate time in the evening. 
Cortisol is related to the wake cycle, it is produced in the morning but it is also produced as a stress response.
Adenosine builds up as you stay awake and the only way to effectively flush out adenosine is to have quality sleep. 
Melatonin is a signal to the brain about the circadian rhythm, it doesn't keep a person asleep so relying on melatonin supplement is not helpful for better sleep.
Instead, play into the natural triggers of sleep such as lower core body temperature, reduce artificial lights after sundown, restrict caffeine consumption 8-10 hours before sleep, and restrict feeding close to sleep.
