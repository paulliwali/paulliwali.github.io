ChatGPT has been an overnight phenomenon, garnering 1 million users in less than one week (5 days). This is faster than any other social platforms.
There have been many interesting uses for it ranging from pickup lines for Hinge to fake New York Times articles.
The biggest implication that people have wondered is the possible replacement of white collar jobs.
Jobs that required thinking can potentially be replaced by this technology.
Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, has started funds generated from ChatGPT to potentially offset any economic damage this might create.
However, it doesn't seem we are there yet - ChatGPT gives very convincing and human like outputs but upon scrutiny there are still much shortcomings when used to answer precise questions with exact answers. 
This shortcoming might be a fundamental flaw with statistical approaches to AI and it will never truly "understand" the knowledge it is using.
