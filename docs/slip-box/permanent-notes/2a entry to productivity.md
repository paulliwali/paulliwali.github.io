- Being productive is to remove the distractions which hinders thinking, enabling one to enter the perfect state of flow.
- The confluence pages (wiki pages) at work is a perfect illustration of this. Team members contribute to a growing list of permanent notes which are linked together to foster more interesting ideas.
- Never starting from a blank page is the secret to enabling higher levels of productivity. To achieve this is through developing a workflow that ensures you always have enough material to only have to establish the connections between them and not be distracted with composing them in the first place.
