Here lies the index to my permanent notes:

* [[1a connecting things]]
- [[2a entry to productivity]]
	- [[2a1 can remote work be productive]]
- [[3a thinking creatively]]

Reference: [[Zettelkasten Method]]

Try to answer the following questions in order to convert fleeting notes into permanent notes:
- How does this fact fit into my idea of a framework or topic?
- How can this phenomenon be explained by that framework or theory?
- Are these two ideas contradictory or they compliment each other?
- Have I heard of this before? Link it to that
- ==What does x mean for y==
