    - Collecting lessons learned from applying statistics in models
- For a project predicting the collision likelihood between trucks and other users on the road, the topic of confidence interval was brought up
    - The technique [[bootstrap-algorithm]] can be used to understand the level of confidence around regression coefficients and predictions
    - Bootstrap algorithm to understand this
    - Discussion with managers about how to implement this
        - Sample for training data (~80%)
        - Normalize the input data (in order to understand the coefficients in a linear regression)
        - Estimate the training data and record the estimated coefficients
        - Repeat n times
        - Note the range of variability of the estimated coefficients, make variable selections
        - Apply the model with the variability of estimated coefficient as the sample space to draw from
- Designing a statistical test
    - For given scenario, we would like to test if something has caused something else to change
        - Null hypothesis: no observable change
        - Alternative hypothesis: observable change
    - There are four properties we care about: **power, significance, sample size, effect size**
        - These are interrelated with each other, and we can solve for any individual property if we define the other 3
    - Power (1 - $$\beta$$)
        - Is the probability to reject null hypothesis 
        - $$\beta$$ is the probability of False Negative or Type II error
    - Significance level ($$\alpha$$)
        - Is the probability to falsely concluding to reject null hypothesis (False Positive or Type I error)
        - This is usually set at a threshold of less than 0.05, giving us the confidence level of ($$1-\alpha$$) of greater than 95%
    - Sample size ($$n$$)
        - As sample size increases, the power increases even if the significance level is held constant because the variance becomes smaller 
    - Effect size ($$e$$)
        - The separation between the means of the two distributions
        - But often if the effect is small, then to increase the power one has to sample more or relax the significance level
