- DRY Principle
    - Don't repeat yourself and remove duplication wherever possible
- SOLID Principles
    - Single responsibility principle
        - A class or module should do one thing only
        - This is important because we **don't want** multiple reasons for why the class or module should change
    -  Open/closed principle
        - Open for extension
            - The class can be inherited or overwritten
        - Closed for modification
            - Should not have switch conditions inside that needs to be changed in order to work
    - Liskov substitution principle
        - Any child type of a parent type should be able to stand in __for__ that parent without things blowing up
        - If you have an `animal` class with `make_noise()` method then any child classes of `cats` and `dogs`, they both should have proper implementations of `make_noise()` and not be throwing an exception 
    - Interface segregation principle
        - Should favour many, smaller, client-specific interfaces **over** a single, larger, monolithic interface
        - If you have an interface with lots of configurations that you have to set up with default values then it is not a good practice
    - Dependency inversion principle
        - Write code that depends upon abstractions rather than concrete details
        - Classes that takes in generic variables instead of instantiating a specific value internally
- Law of Demeter
    - An OOP rule that helps to write clean code
    - > For all classes C, and for all methods M attached to C, all objects to which M sends a message must be:
    * M's argument objects, including the self object or
    * The instance variable objects of C
    - For all classes C, and for all methods M attached to C, all objects to which M sends a message must be:
        - `self`
        - M's argument objects
        - Instance variable objects of C
        - Objects created by M, or by functions or methods which M calls
        - Objects in global variables
    - This means that this law **prohibits "sending a message" to any already existing object that is held in instance variables of __other__ classes, unless it is also held by our class or passed to us as method parameters**
