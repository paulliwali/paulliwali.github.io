    - Started tracking progress with 5/3/1 cycles back in [[January 20th, 2014]] when my body weight was at 150lbs and can OHP 70 lbs, BP 135 lbs, Squat 186 lbs, and deadlift 200 lbs
    - Then over the next 3 years slowly progressed to a peak of OHP 112 lbs, BP 210 lbs, Squat 316 lbs and deadlift 340 lbs at around [[December 11th, 2017]] at a body weight of 170 lbs

    - Then I switched to nsuns 5/3/1 structure and kept the general strength around the same until COVID 2020 hit
- After almost 1 year of not lifting heavy, starting to get back into increasing strength in 2021 with nsuns 5/3/1 and a lot more emphasize on upper-body
