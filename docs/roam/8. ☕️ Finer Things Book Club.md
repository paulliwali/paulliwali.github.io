		* P: similar and uses the same technique of introducing a concept with a catchy name and silly diagram to help you remember
		* A: Read the career path blog and recalls the "yearning octopus"
	* Share the most influential quotes
		* A: "You can be even bigger, you can start a blog, start a podcast, write a book, tweet a tweet, spend 6 years to write a ebook/audiobook. Its not for everyone"
			* You felt this was the most important quote because it explains how to solve our problem, which is to get out there and have discussions (higher minded) with others. Which will also show others that you are out there
		* A: "If Donald Trump tells me to take the vaccine I would not take it - Kamala Harris"
