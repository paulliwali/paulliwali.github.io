- What is meta-cognition?
    - When you learn something new, cramming information non-stop is not effective
    - You need strategies to learn
    - ==Learn how to learn==
    - Meta-cognition is being self-aware of your own thinking, thinking about thinking or knowing about knowing
- Comprises of 3 components
    - Knowledge
    - Regulation
    - Experiences
- Knowledge
    - What you know about yourself and others in terms of thinking and learning process
    - Declarative knowledge
        - What you know about yourself
        - The type of learner that I am is action based
        - The act of doing or writing down information helps me understand the topic
        - I can't rely on listening or reading on their own to retain knowledge
    - Procedural knowledge
        - What you know about learning in general
        - [[spaced-repetition]]
        - [[mindmaps]]
        - [ ] Research about learning techniques [[future]]
    - Conditional
        - Knowing when or why you should use Declarative knowledge and Procedural knowledge
- Regulation
    - The activities and strategies you use to control your learning in order to improve this learning ability
    - Planning
        - Prior to starting to learn a new topic, think about how to allocate energy and time into learning it
        - What kind of strategies to deploy? (See Procedural knowledge)
        - When to use them to maximize my performance
    - Monitoring
        - Stay aware of where I feel like I am struggling
        - Instead of passively receiving all the information, actively question the process
    - Evaluating
        - After finishing a chunk, reconsider the strategy and my performance
        - Make changes before moving on to the next chunk
        - For example, I am currently reading a textbook on transportation modelling and I have been taking linear notes on each chapter. However, while experimenting with Roam, I might move it over to a more fluid and segmented note taking platform
            - [x] Consider migrating Transport Modelling notes to Roam 
- Experiences
    - The thoughts and feelings you have while studying and learning something
    - Awareness
    - Thoughts
    - Feelings
