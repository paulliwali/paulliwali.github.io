# 2023
## Year in review
- A great year of outdoor activities. I was able to do a lot of hiking trips with different variety, from backpacking to day hikes to van trips. Also pushed hard to play lots of volleyball with fairly consistent beach games and even some semi-serious grass tournaments. Also continue to snowboard and surf whenever possible, given that it takes a lot of planning, time and resources.
- Read a ton of interesting book and having the [[8. ‚òïÔ∏è Finer Things Book Club]] really kept me on track when I didn't feel like reading. I think I ended with 9 books read this year but should be able to push to 10 before the very end. See the books here - [[2. üìö to Read]].
- On the personal learning front, it had some mixed results. I finally finished the [[Hands On Machine Learning]] after two years (!) and not really felt like it is contributing to my day to day. I didn't successfully produce any projects and still feel left behind by the rapid development of LLM
