- Daily Log:
    - Start a today I learned log to track random things I learn over a year and post on a website like [this](https://drobinin.com/posts/things-i-learnt-in-2020/)
        - Use [[til2021]] tag for the tidbits
        - They should contain the keyword with link to source, a quick summary of why it is interesting, use quote blocks, and why it is important to note the tidbit
    - [[roam]] introduced templates, I don't need to copy and paste the template page anymore
        - Create a [[㊙️ Templates]] page to store templates
