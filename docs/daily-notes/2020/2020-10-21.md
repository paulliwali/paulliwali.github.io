- ☀️Daily Log:
    - Had a bad sleep last night, woke up at around 0100 and thought it was 0600
        - Couldn’t fall back asleep until probably 0330
        - Felt anxious and had racing thoughts about work
        - Wrote those thoughts down but was still wide awake, so listened to podcasts
        - It might have to do with the fact that I drank 3 cups of coffee [[October 20th, 2020]]
        - It might also have to do with the fact that I took a melatonin before bed
    - Working from home for the first time
        - Was relatively productive, needed to move my phone away next time
    - Setup some workout sessions in the next 3 days in the morning, hopefully 6am is not too early lol
