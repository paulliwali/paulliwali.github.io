  - Lit review paper on inferring trip mode and purpose from GPS data
    - Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042814041597
    - GPS gives richer path data, but needs to be augmented with OD information to be useful
    - Machine learning is often utilized to determine the mode, while rule based methods are popular for inferring purpose
    - Error detection
      - Outliers are identified with unlikely attributes like speed over 250 km/hr
      - Successive filters to remove outliers: number of NSAT used to record (\<3), HDOP (>5), heading and speed of 0 when GPS data trace is plotted, remove multipath error in urban canyons
      - Track points whose distance is less than 10m of the previous one, track points with greater than 200 km/hr speed, track points with less than 5 km/hr and time gap with previous track point of at least 1 minute, delete trips with less than 4 track points
    - Trip identification
      - The combination of dwell time, speed, and visual checks on map to determine when a set of paths is a trip
    - Mode detection
      - Input features (from GPS, GIS, Accelerometer, and Respondent's information)
        - duration, speed, acceleration, distance, HDOP/NSAT, heading, street network, rail station, bus routes, bus stops, ownership of vehicle
      - Machine learning (NN, Bayesian Network, Decision Tree, SVM)
      - Probability Method (Fuzzy logic rules, probability matrix)
      - Criteria based Method
      - Accuracies of high 70-90% seems to be achievable
    - Purpose inference
      - Input features (From GIS, GPS, Respondents' information, other information)
        -  Land use, POI information, duration of stay, trip ending time, frequent activity, key address, demographic data, transport mode
      - Rule based Method (Land-use-and-purpose-matching table, heuristic rules, closest POI matching rules, single deterministic matching method, historical data matching method)
      - Probabilistic method (multinomial logit model, probability calculation based on distance)
      - Machine learning (classification/regression tree, discriminant analysis)
