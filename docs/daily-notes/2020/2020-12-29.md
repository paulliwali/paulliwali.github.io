    - Dear Electric Cars - MKBHD
        - If you are coming out with ~200 mile range car now is already behind
        - Charging network is the other half of the story, and needs to be collaborative
            - You can't do road trip in US not on a Tesla right now
        - Traditional manufacturers missing the compromise they have in terms of features, range and battery tech
        - Tesla's main advantage of battery technology and drivetrain will go away eventually
            - The "car" portion is almost an afterthought
            - This is fine for the early adopters but the mass adopters will want to have tight tolerances in the build quality
            - When to pivot the focus on the built and fit finish for Teslas?
