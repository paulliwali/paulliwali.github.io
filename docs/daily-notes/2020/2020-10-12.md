    - Canadian applying for US credit card
        - Is hard because the lack of credit history in the US
        - No SSN
        - Best [guide](https://princeoftravel.com/blog/getting-us-credit-cards-for-canadians/) I found
            - Which recommends a service called Nova Credit to transfer Canadian credit for US credit card applications
            - The best American Express cards suggested were Hilton, Everyday Cash and Bonvoy
            - But because I think the hotel points is not valuable for me right now, I applied for the Everyday Cash card as my first card
            - No annual fees and good decent sign up bonus is good enough reasons
            - [x] Call American Express to finish the application process
                - Had to call TD and change my address
                - Call AMEX and have them call TD to verify my address
                - Wait 10 business days for the cards arrival
    - Call with law firm to go over TN application interview
        - Focus on engineering aspect and civil/transportation, downplay the software part
        - When travelling in and out of the US while on the TN status, **make sure the I-94 report stays correct**
        - Why do I need to be physically in the US? Answer this truthfully and say that there are aspects to my jobs that requires me to be physically at site
        - Print the first I94 report, it is useful for a lot of applications
        - If they ask whether I will become a US citizen. Say not planning on it, short term plan is to work
        - [x] Send a passport stamp, send i-94 to Carrie
        - [x] Summarize anything unexpected to Carrie, let her know if they ask why I should physically be there
    - Watched a WSJ video on [[UBI]] experiment in South Korea and its initial success
    - [x] Finish Chapter 8 of [[Modelling Transport]]
