- ☀️Daily Log:
    - Call with colleague
        - Talked about my work and how I might need help with research techniques on topics later
        - He updated me with his situation
            - Nearing the end of his PhD but is getting into crunch time for him
            - Need to figure out if the framework he theorized for firm hiring/firing patterns will work
            - He is thinking about working for a think tank or global organization after PhD
            - Loves research but hates writing...
        - I try to formalize my vision for the goal of our team at work
            - To be able to forecast the growth in demand of trips irrespective of where the supercharger are currently located
            - The current model is rough in the sense that it captures a global growth without the spatial context
            - There is nothing that can recommend **where**, because **we don’t know where**
    - Roamed around [[San Francisco]]
        - Finally visited Mission Workshop, a bag and tech gear store that I have loved for a long time
        - Upgraded my shoulder pouch from Timbuk2 to Mission’s akiva styled pouch
        - The akiva attachment is pretty solid, but I do miss the separate compartments on the Timbuk2 version
        - Walked through the big mall on Market and Fifth
        - There were lots of homeless people in the Market/5th area, it doesn’t seem like an appealing place to live
        - Mission district was a lot more boutique and cozier to walk through
