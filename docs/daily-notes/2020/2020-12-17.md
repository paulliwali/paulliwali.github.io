- ☀️Daily Log:
    - Presented to the broad team for the first time
        - Was very stressed about it all night, didn't have a good sleep
        - The key is to keep it simple, logical and have some light/funny anecdotes to bring it close to reality
        - Good feedback from the team
    - 10 Common Software Patterns in a nutshell #article #programming #lists 
        - source: https://towardsdatascience.com/10-common-software-architectural-patterns-in-a-nutshell-a0b47a1e9013
        - Architectural pattern is a **general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context**
        - Layered Pattern
            - For programs that can be decomposed into groups of subtasks, each group is abstracted to a layer
            - Consists of: presentation layer (UI), application Layer (service), business logic layer (domain), data Access Layer (persistence)
        - Client-server Pattern
            - For programs that can be broken into server and multiple clients
            - The server provides services to the clients and listens for requests
        - Master-slave Pattern
            - For programs that can have the work distributed by the master to identical slave components, then collected back to compute the final result
        - Pipe-filter Pattern
            - For programs that produce and process a stream of data
            - Each processing step is enclosed within a filter component
            - Data to be processed is passed through pipes, which is used for buffering or synchronization
            - Compliers or bioinformatics programs might use this
        - Broker Pattern
            - For distributed systems with decoupled components, the components interact via the broker. Examples include Apache Kafka
        - Peer-to-peer Pattern
            - The peers in this pattern are components that can act both as clients or servers
        - Event-bus Pattern
            - This typically has 4 components: event source, event listener, channel and event bus
            - The source publish messages to particular channels on an event bus
            - Listeners will subscribe to channels on the event bus and be notified of the messages that are published to a channel
        - Model-view-controller Pattern
            - Interactive applications use this pattern which divides into 3 parts: model (core functionality and data), view (display the information), controller (handles inputs from the user)
        - Blackboard Pattern
            - Suited for programs with no known deterministic solution strategy
            - Contains 3 components: blackboard (a structured global memory containing object), knowledge source (specialized modules with their own representation) and control (selects, configures and executes modules)
        - Interpreter Pattern
            - For programs that interpret other programs written in a dedicated language
            - SQL is an example of this
