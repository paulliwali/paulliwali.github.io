- Daily Stoic::
    - The writing from Seneca asks to put philosophy first if living life is a priority. The problem is not that I am too busy during the day to make time for things like reading, meditating and pondering - the issue is that in today’s day and age our attention is stolen by everything around us. The introspective activities can’t compete with Reddit, instagram and Netflix.
