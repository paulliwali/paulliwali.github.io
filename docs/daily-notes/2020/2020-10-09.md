- ‚òÄÔ∏èDaily Log:
    - From reading the [[Retrospective]], I realized it was one week ago I migrated to use [[Roam Research]]
        - So far my experience has been very positive, the LaTeX support for math, bi-directional linking, queries, css customization, like-minded community all contribute positively
        - As the daily logs get rolling, the [[Retrospective]] section should get a lot more interesting
    - Figured out the problem I thought I had with my tasks queries is not in the code, but rather when the TODO is created in a daily log it will be associated with that date regardless of any date tag afterwards
