- Daily Stoic::
    - The force that pulls us is __logos__, and we are like a dog being pulled by a cart. The leash is long enough that we can explore around, but at the end of the day we will be pulled in the direction of the cart. We can resist it or accept it, in the end we will still go in the direction of the cart.
