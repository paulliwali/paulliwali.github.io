    - #article "What you can learn from how to ace a YC interview" - Paul Graham
        - Questions:
            - How to to ace your YC interview?
            - How it is mistaken to believe that the only way to become a billionaire is by exploiting people
            - And how these two things are interrelated
        - Paul's job is essentially a billionaire scout, and he claims after all these years, he still don't have one fast rule, and if he did have a rule it is definitely not seeing how well they exploit people
            - **YC looks for founders that can identify and make what a group of users wants**
            - [[quotes]] YC's motto is "make something people want"
            - But in a market economy it is hard to define whether the "want" is real or not
        - ==The challenge is identifying if there is a path to a huge market==
        - A **larval market** is one that is small but growable
            - Apple when it was founded is an example of this
                - Not many people owned personal computers when Apple was founded in 1976, but today that market is massive
            - Founders who are living in the future can identify a want that more people will have as time progresses
            - These markets can also be small in geography, the need is localized in an area but have the potential to spread globally
        - All this needs to be sparked by a seed user group
            - **One of the most important aspect YC interviews will dig into**
            - Who are the first users
            - How do you know they want this?
            - If you can prove the want with prototypes that is being spread by the word of mouth then you might have hit on something good
        - YC doesn't need to be excited like the founders and their users, because that doesn't prove anything
            - They need to be able to see the founders are
            - ==They rely on the founders to explain to them who the users/market is==
        - YC interviews are short, but it is the questions that help the investors to understand the value
            - **Through random access**
        - So to do well in interviews you have to be able to answer to questions well
            - **Answer honestly without prefabricated bullshit**
            - Be honest with competitors, because **competitors rarely kill startups, poor execution does**
        - The most important motivator of them all is - ==to be interested in what you are building==
            - All billionaires share one thing in common, and that is they could have stopped sooner
            - What keeps them working is not the money, but the product itself
            - There is nothing else they'd rather do

- Daily Stoic::
    - It is easy to see how physical things you “own” aren’t really yours and becoming detach to material is good for the mind
    - However, what is harder to accept that precarious things like health, status, relationships are also not yours to own
        - If something external can easily take these away without warning, then they are not ours to own
