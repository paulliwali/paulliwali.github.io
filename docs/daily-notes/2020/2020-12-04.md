- Daily Stoic::
    - It is easy to see how physical things you “own” aren’t really yours and becoming detach to material is good for the mind
    - However, what is harder to accept that precarious things like health, status, relationships are also not yours to own
        - If something external can easily take these away without warning, then they are not ours to own
