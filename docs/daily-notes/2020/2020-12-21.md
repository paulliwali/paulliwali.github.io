- ☀️Daily Log:
    - The daily pull-up/push-up routine has been helpful with getting some high-ish intensity training in
        - One month ago I was going to the gym trying to build back strength, but since then the gyms have been closed due to stay-at-home orders in California
    - Since last week’s work crunch, it has slowed down a bit which gives me some breathing room to finish up some of the menial tasks
        - I should also think about how to contribute to the team in Q1
    - There are also many candidates lined up for potential hiring both as interns and full-times
