- Daily Stoic::
    - Out of two scenarios: something happened, and something happened that wasn’t what you wished for, which is easier to change? It is your acceptance of what happened that dictates how you perceive life. Referred to as the “art of acquiescence”. Stoicism takes this further by appreciating and enjoying it. Nietzsche coined the phrase **amor fatti** meaning a love of fate many centuries later that perfectly captures this idea.
