- ‚òÄÔ∏èDaily Log:
    - YVR ‚úàÔ∏è SFO #work
        - Flying out in the morning at 0800
        - Scheduled a Uber ride at 530 but after arriving early the driver cancelled and dipped...
        - Almost got my luggage stuck inside the condo as I try to bring my 3 checked-in bags out to the street because I left the keys already
        - Then one luggage was overweight while another was over the max allowable weight
            - Had to swap some items into the golf bag carrying my longboard
            - Eventually got it down to having only one overweight luggage (which costs $100!! üò≥)
            - [x] Reimburse luggage costs
        - The flight has a 3 hour layover in YYZ because the border security at Vancouver is less random
        - TN application __did not__ go smoothly
            - The main border guard was slightly junior and was being supervised by another border guard
            - They first ensured my education background and job description matched the requirements of meeting the engineering criteria under the TN status
            - The supervisor was hung up on the job title (Software development engineer), which included the keyword ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù
            - **She was not satisfied with the misaligned job title with my job description/education**
            - They were about to reject my application based on this, they asked if I can reach out the law firm to adjust my job title with work
            - After an hour or so of delays, I communicated back and forth with the law firm without a final change, the main border guard decided to approve my application of 3 years of TN status!
        - Both flights I had an empty seat in the row
        - Picked up all my checked luggage and took the blue train to the rental car companies
        - Drove south on I-101 from SFO to Mountain View, took about 30 minutes, and unpacked at the temporary corporate housing
    - Corporate Housing
        - It is a large complex, that feels like a resort - 4 or so buildings surround a middle yard with swimming pools, hot tubs, seating areas, couches
        - My unit is a big one-bedroom with the washroom interconnected with the living space and bathroom. There is also a walk-in closet, balcony, full kitchen and two TVs
        - __I feel pretty comfortable living here__
        - Tried to wipe down as much as possible and unpacked my clothes and productivity items
    - Grocery at Trader Joe‚Äôs
        - First shopping trip to stock up on some simple foods at none other than Trader Joe‚Äôs
        - The vibe was super positive and there was tons of interesting things items that I will probably come back to get more of
