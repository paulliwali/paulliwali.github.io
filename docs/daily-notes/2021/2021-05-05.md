    - [[video]] [The Future of Reasoning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ArVh3Cj9rw)
        - Reason and logic are struggling to keep up with unintended consequences from our own creations
            - Like climate change from manufactured goods
        - [[til2021]] Hyperobjects
            - Coined by philosopher Timothy Morton
            - Something that is so massively distributed in space, but so sticky that it adheres to everything
            - Any civilization that progresses on reason will create such objects, but the fact that we have not observed any could mean there is a "Great Filter" that the hyperobject create which destroys the civilization
            - An hyperobject we are creating could be the climate effects and if we don't solve it we will be casted out by this great filter
        - **What if reasoning is not built for what we have become**
        - Behavioral inertia
            - Is the tendency to do what we are already doing
        - Reasoning
            - A way of making inferences, making new information from existing information
            - Not automatic inferences like sight, but deliberately
            - Why are we the only species with developed version on this?
            - Why do we have disagreements if reasoning is a "good" skill?
            - Not only are we bad at reasoning due to bias, but these flaws seem to be intentionally built into us
            -  We are built to give reasons for whatever we must, and not reason the logical outcome
        - Intuitions
            - Ability to react to our environment with very low input from our conscious mind
            - Instead of reason from facts to a conclusion, we can jump to the conclusion by gathering very low amounts of information without knowing exactly how
        - **We often use conclusions to come up with reasons**
        - Reasonings evolved to help us to be social instead of reaching logical conclusions
            - From #[[ðŸ“š Books to Read]] The Enigma of Reason - Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber
            - The social theory of reason helps to explain why two people can have different reasons for the same thing - because they are appealing to their own values
        - Confirmation bias
            - Our tendency to find, interpret and conclude evidence that agree with our initial viewpoint
            - Partially developed to reduce cognitive load
        - Lone reasoner
            - It is known that the "average" answer from a crowd to a problem is often more accurate than any individual person
            - Why we tend to have groups deliberate on big decisions instead of letting one person to make an executive decision
        - **What if reasoning is not built for what we have become**
            - What we established
                - Reasoning seems to be a skill used for social purposes and evolved to enable us to function as a group and not to reach logical conclusions
                - A solution that is deliberated and reached by a big group is often better
                - Lone reasoner is susceptible to biases and mistakes
            - What we noticed
                - Such context is becoming less common and it is easier for people to be a "long reasoner"
                - Allows people to disengage from different views and find similar views
                - The internet forces people to find problems and we feel compelled to have an opinion about all of them
                - Specialization and complexity is creating problems that less and less people have basic understandings about
                - So we look for experts to defend our viewpoints, since we are suceptible to any kind of reasoning, the experts solely by existing allows us to feel justified
            - What this means
                - The future of reasoning is the past of reasoning
                - We need to use reasoning more ever than before
                - Lottocracy - decisions are made by people who gets chosen randomly
