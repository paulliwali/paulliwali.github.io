    - [[til2021]] Portmanteau
        - A blend of words in which parts from individual words are formed to make the new word
            - tobit = tobin + probit (the one that started this rabbit hole)
            - smog = smoke + fog
            - motel = motor + hotel
            - brunch = breakfast + lunch
            - Tanzania = Tanganyika + Zanzibar
            - Eurasia = Europe + Asia
            - liger = lion (m) + tiger (f)
            - tigon = tiger (m) + lion (f)
            - Microsoft = microcomputer + software
            - Amtrak = America + track
            - velcro = velours (french for velvet) + crochet (french for hook)
            - Verizon = veritas (latin for truth) + horizon
            - spork = spoon + fork
            - refudiate = refute + repudiate (a mistake by Sarah Palin but later recognized as a word)
        - Similar to contraction but those are formed by words that would otherwise appear together in sequence 
        - Similar to compound but those do not __blend__ the words but just concatenates them
