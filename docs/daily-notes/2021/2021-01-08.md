        - [[quotes]] "Our lives are built of the same few notes, repeated over and over. It's not a grand symphony, full of surprises. It's a song sung in canon, that simply carries on, until the tune gets stuck in your head. But then the verse changes over, and for the life of you, you can't remember how it's suppose to go"
        - The realization that only a few days are memorable
    - [[til2021]] Temporal Illusion
        - An illusion that plays on our perception of time
        - We experience time in two ways, prospectively - actively through the passage of time, and retrospectively - recalling the passage of time
        - One illusion we experience with empty or full events (boring or exciting events) is that the empty events feel long prospectively but short retrospectively while the full events feel short prospectively but long retrospectively
            - i.e. On vacation while waiting for the flight can feel long in the moment and the actual vacation can feel short and flied by in a blink of an eye. However, when recalling the events, waiting for the flight will seem insignificant to the actual vacation
        - This leads to the TV illusion which is a prominent experience of modern life  where you feel time passes by while you are experiencing it **and **when you recall upon it.
            - When watching TV, it might feel that a few hours passed by as if they were minutes. And when recalling that experience weeks or months later, it was not memorable enough for us to associate large amount of time with that activity
            - Feeling that events are empty is a struggle that many of us today deal with because of the one-way stimulation from different social platforms and entertainment sources

        - Just an amazing word, it describes the realization that everyone you pass by is living a life as vivid, memorable and important as your own
        - [[quotes]] "The realization that each random passerby is living as life as vivid and complex as your own - populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness - an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you 'll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk."
