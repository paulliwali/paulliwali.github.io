    - [[thoughts]] Randomly, I recalled feeling scared of moving to California and starting my new job. The unknowns of living and working at a new place was daunting. I felt nauseous in the pit of my stomach and wanted to curl up. I was comfortable with where I was; I knew the city and the people but more importantly I had a path forward with my work and felt content in the moment. I tried to convince myself that feeling uncomfortable is the sign that you are doing the right thing. Maybe it didn't fully win me over, but I held onto that belief by a strand. I would tell myself that I have gotten complacent and that's not good. LIfe is for living and being complacent is a sign of dying.
