- Daily Log:
    - PC is finally up and running
        - Purchased a Windows bootable USB from amazon 
        - Updated the BIOS to 2.6 in order to support the Ryzen 5000 CPUs
        - Then recreated my own bootable USB
        - Re-formatted and installed Windows again
    - The crazy thing that I can't explain is that only creating a bootable drive with both x64 and x32-bit versions work
    - Crashes with lots of games though, need to investigate why
