    - #crypto Decentralized applications on Ethereum Network
        - One of the biggest differences between BTC and ETH is that the ETH network enables developer to make DAPPs
        - DAPPs are decentralized applications that runs on the ETH network and powered with Ether
        - This mainly allows immutable data storage and smart contracts for application logic
            - Smart contracts are public so you can see the logic and know exactly the outcome
            - These are also immutable so they can’t be changed once made live
            - Special programming patterns are created to help developers to make DAPPs, such as Eternal Storage or Proxy Contract, where the business logic and data are separated so the business logic can be updated

- Daily Stoic::
    - It is interesting that we all know what we __should__ do, and we regret not doing the right thing later not because we didn’t know. So instead of saying we won’t do something, we say we will do it later.
