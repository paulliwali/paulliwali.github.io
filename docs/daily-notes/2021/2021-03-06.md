- Daily Stoic::
    - Narrative fallacy is the when you connect unrelated events together into a story to create a sense of cohesion and certainty that isn't real
        - This happens in data science a lot because you want to create a story around the statistics you are presenting to make a compelling point
    - Don't tell stories of your past to avoid this fallacy but also it is self-absorbent for others to hear
    - Live in the real and listen and connect with others, don't put on a performance for them
