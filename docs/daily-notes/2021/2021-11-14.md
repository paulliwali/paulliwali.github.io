- ☀️Daily Log:
    - Dealing with lots of zeros in data #data-science
        - Data transformation
            - Use log, sqrt, box-cox to transform the skew
        - Zero-inflated models (__count__)
            - Designed to deal with situations where there is an "excessive" number of individuals with count of 0
            - In situation where there is __overdispersion__, characterized by the conditional variance is greater than the conditional mean, a zero-inflated model such as **zero inflated Poisson (ZIP)** would fit better
                - This model assumes there are two sorts of individuals: one group whose counts are generated by the standard Poisson regression model and another group (absolute zero group) who have zero probability of a count greater than 0
                - The model __typically includes a logistic regression model to predict which group it belongs to__
            - Another model that does this is the **negative binomial** model or the special version of the **zero inflated negative binomial** model
        - Hurdle Model
            - A binomial model to predict whether the values are 0 or > 0, then a linear model (or Gamma, log-Normal, truncated-Normal) to model the observed non-zero values
        - Tobit Model
            - Assumes normal distribution and zero-censored
