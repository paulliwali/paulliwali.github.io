    - #nobo Day 6 notes
        - No longer taking timestamp schedules, it seems to be a more regular-ish schedule
        - Was able to be in her crate from 1am to 7am wake up, the poop time seems to be pushed from 4am to 7am when she wakes up after eating breakfast
    - #article [The Real Book](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-real-book/)
        - A music book that almost every jazz musician owned in 1970s
            - Contains hundreds of jazz "standards", which are common tunes, annotated by hand
        - This was an __illegal book__ because it was unlicensed
        - Copies were being made privately and discretely
        - The origin of the Real Book came from the Fake Book which were collections of Tune-Dex cards that summarized songs for radio
            - The Fake Book helped musicians to "fake" their way through unfamiliar songs
            - But it became outdated as Jazz continued to evolve
        - Steve Swallow met two students who wanted to create The Real Book - an update to the Fake Book
            - They listened to recordings and transcribed the chord changes of classics or new songs
            - Made bootlegs copies of them and sold it around Berkley and soon everyone learning Jazz was holding a copy
