- Daily Log:
    - #nobo
        - Drove to Sausalito in the morning and took her out for a brisk walk
        - She walks on a leash much better than I expected, the only time she is not cooperative is if she knows we are going back into the car or she is on a patch of grass
        - Then we drove around SF downtown, charged at Van Ness Supercharging station which is a paywall site ($7 for parking per hour)
        - Lots of compliments on nobo
        - Brian and Maggie came down for lunch to checkout the area, she got so excited seeing them she peed on her way to greet them
        - Took her up to the rooftop terrace and ground floor terrace and its actually a super nice area to lounge and chill
        - Then, met a friend that lives in the condo and took her to meet him over dinner and she was also well behaved for the most part
        - She got a little bit nervous with certain people (I don't know what the pattern is)
        - Also she is starting to realize the taste of better treats and the kibbles are not doing it for her when we are outside or she is slightly full

    - If you don't know what to aim for, you will never achieve it. Same thing with being the character or person you want to be. Have a target and work towards it.
