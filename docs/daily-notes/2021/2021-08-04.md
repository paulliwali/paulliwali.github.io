    - 3n+1 problem #til2021
        - is a trivial problem in math where there are two rules: you take an odd number and apply 3n + 1 to it and take an even number and apply n / 2 to it
        - the sequence will resolve into 4, 2, 1 loop
        - it has some other interesting properties such as that it has a decreasing trend but follows a random Brownian motion described as hail stone
        - the distribution of the first digit follows [[Benford's Law]] which asserts randomness
