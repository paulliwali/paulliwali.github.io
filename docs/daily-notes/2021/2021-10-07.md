    - Tesla Stockholder's Earnings Call
        - Rockets Equation applies well to factory efficiency 
            - $$\Delta v=v_e\ln\frac{m_o}{m_f}$$
                - $$\Delta v$$ is the maximum change of velocity
                - $$m_o$$ is the initial mass, with propellant (wet mass)
                - $$m_f$$ is the final mass, without propellant (dry mass)
                - $$v_e$$ is the effective exhaust velocity
            - Named after Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky
        - It takes us just as long to build a factory compared to getting to full production level
