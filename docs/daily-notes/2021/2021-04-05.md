    - [[Nobo]] Notes 
        - Donâ€™t let her associate certain experiences with fear, remove her from the situation if I see her scared - tucked tail, licking lips, ears back, etc
        - First vet visit 
            - Recommended not to go outside and touch the grass until she has all her vaccines at week 16
            - Use indoor pee pads for the time being
            - Otherwise her heart is healthy, the only thing is her knee cap might pop in and out when she gets older (common with poodles) and she has a small hernia on her stomach which causes an outie
            - Visit again on [[May 1st, 2021]] for second shot
            - Gave me two oral medicines for ticks/fleas and heartworms, if I like them I can continue to use them
        - Not taking her outside every time I think she wants to pee actually makes my life much easier because she is way more calmer and sleepier
            - 3 am poop and pee
            - 7 am breakfast and then after the pee we went to vet
            - 8 am to 9 am vet
            - 10am to 2pm nap
                - Woke her up for lunch at 12 to eat but fell asleep after lunch
            - 2 pm poop and pee
                - Took a stool sample and return it to the vet, expecting a call in 24/48 hours
            - 3 pm to 5 - nap
            - 5:20pm - poop and pee in the right spot
            - 6pm - dinner for her
            - 6:30pm - poop again in the right spot
            - Bathed her at around 6:40 and then proceed to pee like 4 times before and after the bathing
            - It seemed like she just pees non stop if we are playing outside the crate, but she has so much energy right now compared to the morning and afternoon time
            - from 5 to 7 she has so much energy and peeing potential
            - 730pm to 830pm on/off napping with me doing errands
            - 830 pm onwards fully sleeping
        - Usually super energized after a nap and needs lots of playing until she poops/pee. The peeing usually happens after drinking water and wandering in that direction
            - But when she is hyper she likes to bite/chew the pee pad
            - Need to keep her occupied and use up her energy until she is ready to use it as a pee pad
            - Remember to watch her in danger areas (new areas, places she has peed before, after drinking water, after napping)
        - Overall day 3 the biggest realization is that she sleeps way more than I was experiencing in the last 2 days because of the over stimulation from outside is probably not giving her the best sleep schedule
            - She can hold her potty while in cage but be wary the moment she comes out till she goes back - needs to be constantly watching unless she is sleeping

- Daily Stoic::
    - Don't let the force of impression carry you away. Ask questions and test it first, we are really quick on making split decisions and judgement calls - but sometimes consider it longer
