    - [[data-science]] Hurdle Models
        -  Linear models assume some level of normality in the response variable being predicted
            - If there is skew such that the response variable doesn't follow a normal distribution - then we correct the skew with transformations like log, sqrt and box-cox power
        - However, in some instances, there are clear cases of multi-modal distribution with lots of values at zero
            - Transformation only change the scale of the variable but doesn't change the distribution
            - __This is a good indication that there are data which belongs in two or more distinct underlying data generation processes__
        - Common applications: insurance claims (where most people don't claim)
            - Also applies to us, where most site-days don't experience waiting
        - First model - a binomial classifier trained and tested on all the data
        - Second model - a regressor trained only on true positive samples but used to make predictions on all the test data
        - Implmentation
            - You can build two separate models
            - Or extend `scikit.BaseRegressor` such that it can be passed in grid search functions and evaluation functions

    - [[data-science]] Classifying Historgrams
        - Use [[hierarchical clustering]] or [[DBSCAN]]
            - They are better than [[k-means]] because they work with arbitrary distance measures such as **Jensen-Shannon divergence**
            - Which is designed to capture similarity of distributions
        - [[DBSCAN]] stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
        - [[hierarchical clustering]] which builds a hierarchy of clusters
            - Agglomerative - a bottoms up approach
            - Divisive - a top-down approach
