- Daily Stoic::
    - There are three types of people at a grocery line, those that find a short line and sticks it out, those that switches constantly, and those that switches once if they see their line is obviously delayed and there is a clear alternative
        - Try to go through life with the mindset of the third type, just because you are slowed down in your current path doesn't mean you have to stick to it but don't give up without any good reason
