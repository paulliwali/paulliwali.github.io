            - Non-Qualified Options (NQs)
                - Usually have no favorable tax treatments
                - When exercised the delta between market price and exercise price is realized, and that is usually treated as __ordinary income__

                - When sold the delta between price and market price when exercised is treated as capital gain/loss
                    - Short term capital gain/loss may apply

                - Usually have favourable tax treatments

                - Only when sold is when the tax is calculated
                - Can be treated as a qualifying disposition which has favourable tax considerations if it meets:
                    - Hold for more than 1 year after exercise
                    - Hold for more than 2 years after grant date
