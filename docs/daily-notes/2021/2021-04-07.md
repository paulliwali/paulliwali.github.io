        - 7:00am wake up, pretty high energy
            - Pee after the usual belly rubs and greeting
            - Some breakfast with kibble in a bowl and some small training with low calorie training
            - **Fed her the heart-worm oral vaccines with the high value treat, otherwise she was picking it out of her bowl and not eating it**
            - **Pooped at 7:17am**
            - Played a lot with her toys, especially when she gets chewy on other things
            - Peed again 
        - 7:40am - 940am nap
            - peed when she got out
            - she might also be too hot? Seems to be content with lying on the floor after getting out
        - 940am - 1130am working with her leashed to cage
            - She is just lying around chewing on things while napping on the floor under the coffee table

            - Peed
            - Fed her kibble while training, then some dehydrated food while she is in her crate
        - 1150am - 1230pm calm play
            - I ate lunch while securing her to the island and gave her a bully stick to chew on
        - 1230pm - 2:40pm nap
            - Put her into her crate, she didn't seem too sleepy yet

- Daily Stoic::
    - Always question our understanding to fight the biases and preconceptions
        - What haven't I considered?
        - Why is this thing the way it is?
        - Am I part of the problem here or the solution?
        - Could I be wrong here?
    - Arrogant opinion and mistrust are two things that we must remove from ourselves because it holds us back
