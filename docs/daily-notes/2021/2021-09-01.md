    - #finance Equity decisions
        - Ensure that the total income (when RSUs vest and exercised) is below ~165k to stay within the federal tax bracket
        - Potentially take out a line of credit using RSUs as collateral to pay the tax instead of `sell-to-cover`
            - This is works if the interest on the line of credit is less than the expected gains from the stocks itself
            - Otherwise `sell-to-cover`
