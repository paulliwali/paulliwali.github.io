    - Thinking about some big things I have that I want to get around doing
        - ==Refresh the website with more blogs==
        - ==Create a framework for generating interesting plots for NBA and NFL==
        - How can this be achieved with the things I have planned in [[0. Roam Life üó∫]]?
            - [[3. Continued üë®‚Äçüíª]] has some skill development opportunities that I can weave the plot framework into
            - [[üì¨ Slip Box Index]] building can help with blogs and [[2. üìö to Read]] and continue to make effort to have good notes

        - [[til2021]] 6 cosmic numbers
            - From Martin Reese's book Just Six Numbers, the six numbers that shaped the universe and how improbable life is
            - $$N$$ - ratio of the strength of the electrical force to the gravitational force
                - If the ratio was just slightly smaller then the stars would have much reduced lifecycle which would have not enabled Earth to develop
            - $$\epsilon$$ - how strongly atomic nuclei bond together
                - Determines the power output from stars and the types of elements produced from these stars
                - Chemical composition of the universe is greatly affected by this number
            - $$\Omega$$ - measures the amount of material in the universe
                - If this is too high then the universe would have collapsed already from the big crunch
                - If this is too low then stars and galaxies can't form
                - The initial expansion speed of the universe and the amount of matter in it was finely tuned for life
            - $$\lambda$$ - an assumed antigravity effect that modifies the rate of expansion of the universe
                - It has recently re-surfaced as a possible explanation for the slowing down of the universe expansion
            - $$Q$$ - degree of structure in the universe
            - $$D$$ - number of spatial dimensions
            - Are these numbers coincidence or planned?
                - John Leslie (Canadian Philosopher) said "suppose you are facing a firing squad. Fifty marksmen take aim, but they all miss. If they hadn't all missed, you wouldn't have survived to ponder the matter. But you wouldn't just leave it at that - you'd still be baffled, and would seek some further reason for your good fortune"

    - It is not shunning the vices or avoiding the virtues, it is adopting indifference to them and accepting that they will come and go
