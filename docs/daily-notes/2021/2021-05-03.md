    - Cheapoair refund
        - Called them several times and basically had to do the work for them, the agent said if I want to know the status of my cancellation I should just call - which is ridiculous
        - And as I was asking the process he actually realized that the process wasn't initiated and sent an email with temp passcode which I would have had to call in again
        - The refund went back onto my mastercard which is canadian and that kind of sucked, which means I have to carry a negative balance until I can find a way to spend it
