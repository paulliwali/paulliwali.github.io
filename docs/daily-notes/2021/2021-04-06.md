    - [[Nobo]] Day 4 Notes
        - Schedule
            - 11:00pm - 12:00am play
                -  a pretty high energy session after the 8pm nap
                - peed in the right place
            - 4:00am pee break
                - was a low energy session with lots of petting and sitting
                - peed the moment she got out
            - 7:00am breakfast
                - she was calm in her crate waiting for me to open up
                - we played and trained using her kibble as breakfast food (it seems that’s a better thing to do than making her a bowl of food for now)
                - she pooped in the middle of the training session on the pad, she likes to sniff it - not sure if that’s normal (__it is quite normal, it is how they see__)
                - we played until 8 and gave her bully stick to chew on until 820
                - she peed two times all together on the pad
            - 8:15am - 9:45am nap
                - put her into her crate, I put her in before she was showing that she was super tired, but wanted to see if I can sit on the couch and she will whine and sleep
                - very short nap
            - 9:45am - 10:30am play
                - **Pooped at 1015am** after taking her out of crate to feed her some kibble and training
            - 10:30am - 11:50am nap
                - nap while I went to return the rental car, was very calm when I returned
                - I took some time to eat my lunch while she went in and out of sleep
            - 12pm - 12:40pm lunch
                - played around, ate lots of food, peed (no poop)
            - 12:40pm - 2:15pm nap
                - put her into the crate, took a while for her to fall asleep
                - Took her out of crate at 1:30pm because she was sleeping in the crate, and she fell asleep on the floor, i think she is getting too hot in the crate, she was panting and stuff
                - She likes the cold floor a lot more during the day
                - Put her back into the crate so I can pick up some groceries at whole foods
            - 2:15pm - 4:00pm nap
                - took her out of the crate and she napped on my leg
                - slow wake up just slowly licking and clawing things
            - 4:00pm - 530pm play/dinner
                - trained her with kibble/treats
                - fed a small portion of dehydrated for dinner
                - **pooped at 515pm after 45mins or 1hour of eating**
            - 5:30pm - 6:50pm nap
                - I made dinner in the meantime
                - She was lightly sleeping
            - 7:00pm - 8:30pm play
                - First we just did simple play, nothing too high energy for this session
                - Lots of training with the low calorie treats
                - Peed three times all at the right place
                - **I should try to brush her when she is chewing/tired and outside of the crate or else she might associate the crate as something that happens in**
            - 8:30pm - 9:00pm light nap
            - 9:15pm lights out for bed
            - 1:30am - 2:30am play pretty high energy
                - Small treats just for pee and poop
                    - **poop at 1:45am**
                - Lot of running and zoomies around the house
                - Lot of chewing and biting, needed two rounds of bull sticks
        - Overall
            - She already sits and waits usually when she doesn’t have anything distracting her, so she will sit and look at you
            - I am adding the command **SIT** right before she does it but she does it so often the problem I am having is that she might not always associate sitting down with **SIT**
            - Also trying to treat her when she follows me around the house
            - Teaching her the command **CRATE** to get her enter it
            - Once she is full, she has no interest in food
            - Her poop schedule is slightly shifted now the first one of the day is at 7ish, second one at 
            - Today she has way more energy in the day compared to yesterday when when slept mostly during the day after the vet visit 
                - Is it because of the car rides and outside trips made her mentally tired?
                - Will have to see if she is energetic between 5pm - 7pm today or will see be more tired during that time compared to yesterday
