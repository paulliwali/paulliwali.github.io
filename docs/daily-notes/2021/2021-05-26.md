    - #nobo
        - Her potty is a bit erradic and her stool is a bit runny, could be from the stress/excitement from going outside
            - So going to take a few breaks with her walks to get her acclimated better
            - It could also be from eating new treats (beef liver)
            - Monitor this for the next few days
        - Vet called back and said her urine is clean and said maybe the growth around the area could be catching urine and getting it infected
        - Went out for an hour and came back with puke and diarrhea in Nobo's crate
            - It seemed to be all of her morning breakfast
            - She seemed down and low energy
            - I wonder if its the Cranberry extract that was fed with her morning meal that's causing this?

    - We are very interesting in that we are narcissistic for the most part, but we need the validation from others to know if we made the right decision. Just __think__ what you __think__.
