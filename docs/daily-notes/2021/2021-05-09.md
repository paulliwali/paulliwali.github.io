    - #nobo First time sick
        - After napping in the afternoon, she started to use the pee pad very very frequently, within 30 minutes she had the urge to pee like 10 times
        - After the initial pee, all the other attempts were empty squats or very small dribbles
        - Called the hospital and they told me it could be UTI and just monitor her energy levels and appetite
        - She didn't vocalize any discomfort or pain while squatting to pee but her gait seems a little funny
        - She also seems to be unable to control the urges because she would pee all over the house
            - She even peed inside her crate which she has not done since the very first day
        - I slept on the couch through the night so I can take care of her if she made lots of noises, but she didn't
        - In the morning I found a few pee spots with very yellow pee and some dribbles with shades of red
            - Called the Sage Clinic for 24/7 support and they said to visit the regular vet
