    - Covid Vaccine Delays
        - Bilateral deals were made between countries and pharmaceutical companies directly
        - This gave immense funding to vaccine development but also delayed the pandemic because it delayed vaccines to poorer countries
        - This increases infections/new variant developments in poor countries
