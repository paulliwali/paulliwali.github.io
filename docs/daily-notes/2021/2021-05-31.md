    - Dream's cheating controversy
        - Dream is a popular minecraft Youtuber/Streamer who has been caught in a cheating controversy from October of 2020
        - He submitted a several minecraft speedruns and the mods investigated the runs and claimed Dream must have used a modded version of the game in order to encounter the scenarios that he did
        - Dream hired his own mathematician shortly after and released a report that refuted the mods' claims
        - Both side released very "mathematical" LaTeX documents arguing using statistics to prove their points
        - Some key facts
            - Minecraft speedrun on v1.6 is to fight and kill the ender-dragon. This is predicated mainly on two important chance events
                - Ender pearl drops and blaze rod drops
            - The combined probability of both things happening at the rate it was shown in Dream's submitted runs had the odds of $$1 \text{ in } 2\times10^{22}$$
                - __Using binomial probability formula for both events and multiplying the probabilities together__
        - Mod's argument was that this was extremely unlikely but they did mention how various biases can decrease this odd
        - Dream's counter-argument was using these sampling biases to recalculate the odds given that we are only seeing the runs he submitted
        - **However, all of this doesn't matter**
            - The one fact both sides agree on is that the simple probability of the item drops in Dream's submitted run had the odds of $$1 \text{ in } 2\times10^{22}$$
            - Regardless of how this sample was taken, it is an __extremely__ unlikely event
                - The most unlikely confirmed event from chance based game was 154 rolls of non-seven in a craps game and that had the odds of $$1 \text{ in } 1.6 \times 10^{12}$$
                - If 10 billion people for every second in a century had a Minecraft run the chance of an observed event happening  has the odds of $$1 \text{ in } 3.1 \times 10^{19}$$
            - So even if there was biases from sampling, the likelihood of this happening is still 1000 times less likely to happen than an 10 billion people century second event
        - > Takeaway: The biggest takeaway I have is our inability to grasp exponentials past a certain point. We need to ground the extremely large (or small) numbers in events that we can explain with words
