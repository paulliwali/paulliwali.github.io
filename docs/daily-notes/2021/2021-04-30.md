    - #nobo
        - First car ride outside of her crate, used a seatbelt attachment
        - When we got into the car she was very scared, she went as far as she could to get on top of my lap and panted a lot
        - I tried to feed her high value treats to help her feel like this is a safe space
        - As I drove, she was just clinging onto any part of me that she could reach
        - After we got to destination, we sat for a bit and she was able to sit quietly on her seat, albeit still panting quite a bit
        - Then the drive back was a bit better, but overall she was still nervous and reserved. She didn't bark or anything so that was good
