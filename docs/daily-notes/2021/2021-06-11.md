        - Back is still sore during the day, it gets loosened up once warmed up and doesn't impact strength
        - Failed on second rep of BP so after this cycle is complete, going to focus on building some base volume up for chest before going back onto the linear progression
        - Seems to be nearing the end of the weekly linear progression gains for the major lifts, I can feel the impending wall coming so I am proactively changing the schemes to help me get past it
