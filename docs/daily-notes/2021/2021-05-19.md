    - Rebalanced my personal portfolio to include ETH with AXP gains #investment #personal
        - For the past year crypto has been on a rise and very recently BTC, ETC, Doge, Alt-coins have been in the news because larger companies are talking about it and people are starting to invest in it
        - The biggest market value is still BTC but its inefficiencies due to [[proof-of-work]] is creating lots of environmental concerns
            - Which can lead to country bans
        - ETH just converted from [[proof-of-work]] to [[proof-of-stake]] which reduces its energy consumption by 99%
            - Ref: https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/
        - Thus, I am a little bit more bullish on ETH. But at the end of the day I should probably invest in both
        - If I had more liquid assets, I would probably invest more into crypto
