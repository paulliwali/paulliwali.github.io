- Daily Log::
    - Took and passed the behind the wheel test, got a full California driver's license
        - The start was stressful, I forgot my permit and DMV almost cancelled my appointment which would have led to a reschedule and renting a vehicle for another day
        - The test itself was fairly easy, no highways, parking. There was some knowledge test about turns and how to operate the vehicle (didn't know where emergency break was)
        - I got docked a few points for turning a bit too wide and making the turns to the wrong lane by stepping on the line
    - Got news that the bernedoodle litter was born, so need to start to amp up the prepping for training, supplies, vaccines
    - End of a busy sprint at work to deliver the 2021Q1 build plans to the field
        - Working on both the coverage model and capacity model

- Daily Stoic::
    - An interesting analogy for life is that it is a banquet, and if something catches your attention you help yourself to a modest serving but if something you desire is not here just wait patiently
        - Very different mentality compared to the "go get it" attitude which I think is useful to have in certain times of your life
