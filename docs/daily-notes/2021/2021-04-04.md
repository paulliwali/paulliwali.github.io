- Daily Log:
    - Day 2 with #nobo
        - Woke up at 4am to poop outside, seems like that's a good sign
        - But peeing is a little out of control at the moment, she seems to be pretty frequently, just under 2 hours and pretty free going. Sometimes she goes to the corner pee pad sometimes just middle of the room
        - I am trying to reward for using the corner pee pad just because it is too difficult to take her outside right now
        - Speaking of taking her outside, she seems to be a little timid of people, would sit or retreat when seeing people walking. It is getting a bit better the more she meets and does not have a response
    - She pooped once at 4am, 3pm (so pretty large gap in her poop schedule)
    - She pees very frequently and likes to pee in the corner of the room instead of outside. When she pooped she didnâ€™t pee
        - She came home, was zooming around the house and try to drink more water and went to pee in the corner
