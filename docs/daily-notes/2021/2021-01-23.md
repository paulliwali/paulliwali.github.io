- Daily Stoic::
    - Money doesn't solve internal problems. The rich are the same as the poor when it comes down to internal struggles and money doesn't fix that
        - Very relevant to the conversation I had yesterday with friends, they were wondering if working hard at my job is worthwhile
        - I said that working this hard at a job is new to me, I can feel that it won't be gratifying in the long-term. I won't' look back in 5, 10, 20 years and recall this experience fondly
        - Though, that may not be a good way of evaluating this experience right now
        - I think my main goal is to find an internal balance between learning and enriching myself with new skills and working for the sake of a paycheck
        - If I can see long-term value in my work then I am happy to spend the time to work on it
            - Currently that would be DS skills with Python, SQL; industry knowledge
            - Need to supplement this with self-learning
