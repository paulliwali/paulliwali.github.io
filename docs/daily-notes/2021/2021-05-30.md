        - Energy has returned to maybe 75%, took her on a short walk and she started with good energy but quickly got tired
        - Her runs are still a bit odd, like she can't stop as easily

        - These past few cycles on the 5/3/1 has been really strong, feel good with squats and bench, hoping to continue this linear progression for as long as possible
        - The added volume on secondary exercises for the chest has helped with the work capacity on bench which is my weakness
