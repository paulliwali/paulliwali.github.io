    - #nobo
        - Started regular morning and after dinner walks [[May 24th, 2021]]
        - She is pulling from excitement from sniffing new things outside but on the way back she pulled less and walked beside me consistently
        - I felt comfortable having her off leash in a large park area because she seems very attentive to where I am and never stray off on her own. She also seems very responsive to my calls even when she is focused on eating grass or sniffing things
        - When I run she will chase which is a good sign and need to constantly reward her
