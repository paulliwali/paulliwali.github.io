- Daily Stoic::
    - How you do anything is how you do everything
        - Focus on the present
        - I tend to not put my entire focus or energy in the task at hand but rather planning and preparing for the future tasks
        - I need to work on dedicating time to do the planning but when executing the task be more present in it and focus on it
