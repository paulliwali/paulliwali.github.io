    - [[Random Podcast Notes]] Interview with Chuck Palahniuk
        - Giving the audience small series of wins to allow them to feel smart about themselves allows the author to then be able to manipulate how they feel
        - Having the readers realize the horror, revelation or truth gives them the burden and the visceral reaction of holding it before the character is able to experience it
        - Writing in disjointed fragemens without transition so the reader is able to piece together the scene in their own mind
        - Changing texture of the story by transitioning from first POV to second to third constantly
        - Referenced a brain study that said people stop having physiological changes at the age of 31-33

- Daily Stoic::
    - Do I have a mantra that I often go back to?
        - I used to have this phrase "be humble, stay low" inscribed on every desk, notebook or study sheet in high school to remind myself not to be over zealous over achievements. To always remind myself to return to the roots of hard work and persistence in order to achieve my goals
        - I don't rely on this phrase as often as before, but I think I still remind myself to not be overly confident when things are going well or seem to be going well because I know how fragile success can be
        - When you are content and stop working, life will catch up to you really quickly and leave you behind
        - Always put in the work, especially after you feel like you've achieved something
