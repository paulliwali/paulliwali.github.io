    - Picking up #nobo!
        - Was planning to rent a sedan but all they had was a convertible, which made the drive up to Sacramento that much harder
            - Angela had to carry Nobo on her lap all the way back
            - Nobo was so calm during the ride, very friendly, lets us touch her and pet her in all ways
            - Didnâ€™t whine or bark
        - Then my ride back with just her back home was pretty tough - had to put her in the basket with the top shell as well 
            - She wined and whimpered in the beginning but fell asleep for the most part of the drive
        - When I got her back home she immediately pooped in the corner of the house and also peed in the house
            - I tried to walk her outside to pee/poop but she did neither
            - then I brought her back in, played a little fed her and made her somewhat comfortable with the large cage
            - But if I shut the cage completely she will whine and bark 
    - First day experience with #nobo
        - Very tired already, Nobo is so attached to me that it is hard for me to put her in her crate so I can do things on my own
        - I am overwhelmed on the first day with being able to juggle with having her and make food for myself and etc
        - Maybe I need to leash her while at home as well
        - I know it will only get better but first day is very overwhelming, stressful, exhausted
    - Right now as I am typing this she is pretty tuckered out after the day - maybe we did enough activities to tire her out 
        - She pooped at 9pm and mid poop moved spots and pooped more on new spot 
        - Need lots more pee pads it seems

    - We are at civil war with ourselves because the things we want and the things we do can be opposite. Sit down and clarify to ourselves "Ok, what do I __really__ want?"
