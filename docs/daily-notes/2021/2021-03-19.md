	    - Online bi-level optimization framework for smart mobility, the two levels comprised of master problem and sub problem
			- System optimization (MP) is done at each rolling period
                - Prediction based to attain system level objective
            - User optimization (SP) is done live upon request
                - Based on the individual preferences and options available to the user
        - User preferences are updated online via a Bayes and Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo simulation procedure, then saved offline periodically in a pool
        - Smart mobility applications
            - Taxi, ridesharing, tolled lanes, congestion pricing, congestion tokens
