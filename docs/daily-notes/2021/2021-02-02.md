    - GME Stocks Self Summary
        - Started with HF shorting the company, which is allowed and part of the market
        - But then the shorting became cyclical and there were more stocks in open short positions than there are stocks in existence
        - So a few redditors started to buy the stocks to "squeeze" the short position (u/deepfuckingvalue)
            - As the stock rises in price from the purchases, the people in the short position loses money forcing them to close their short position which drives the price up
        - This snowballed into a whole community of redditors on WSB to collectively buy this stock and drive the price from $5 to $300+ in one week
        - The dramatic jump in price forced some HF to close their short position and allow retail investors to profit greatly
        - Then, it seemed like Wall Street got together and formulated a plan
            - First, Robinhood froze all transactions of these "meme" stocks for a two days. Then it limited the daily purchase to only 1 per user. These two things significantly stalled the buying momentum and stagnanted the price
            - Following this, the price started to dive down with very low traditing volume
                - One explanation is this is a result of HF selling to each other to drive the price down and scare retail investors into selling their stocks
            - So as of today, the price dropped to below $100 a share.
                - Mentality on WSB seems to be to HODL, because as long as they don't sell the shares eventually the short contracts will expire and the HF are forced to buy at whatever price the retail investors want to sell at
        - This event is now a battle between the little guys and the big guys of wall street, between the normal joes and billionaires
        - Interesting point from Jordan Belfort
            - People will lose lots of money from this and be sure to not invest in more than you can afford to lose
            - Don't try to get in at the start just make sure to get out before it ends
        - Mark Cuban had an AMA on reddit
            - He seems to be encouraged by the
