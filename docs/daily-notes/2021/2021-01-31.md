    - The 6 year old GPU I ordered arrived, can start building it this week
    - I caved in and bought the old GPU because bitcoin and the miner's need for GPU has caused the current gen to be permanently out of stock and 20%-50% MSRP price bump
    - Update to the 2021 PC build
        - Add the GPU cost and total cost
