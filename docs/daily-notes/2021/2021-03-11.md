    - [[Movies]] - Star Wars Episode II
        - I think this is the weakest of the prequels, the acting of all the main characters is boring, stiff and cringeworthy
        - The young Anakin of Episode I was cute and innocent, this version of Anakin is awkward, confusing, unbelievable for an audience to get behind his motivation and eventual transition to the dark side in Episode III
