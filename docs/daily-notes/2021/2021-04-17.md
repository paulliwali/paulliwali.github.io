    - #nobo notes
        - She is getting weary of me carrying her into the crate, she doesn't complain too much when in her crate but starting to avoid me picking her up
        - She is quick to learn commands with food, able to get her to understand fetch, drop it, sit, crate. Sit is the most consistent one, can be done under lots of different conditions. Drop it is the least consistent, can only be done with her toys and nothing new she picked up
        - Her nails are kinda sharp and is scratching up my legs - need to trim them
