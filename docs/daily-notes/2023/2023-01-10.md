## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- There has been a dichotomy of approaches to AI: Statistical approach and Symbolic approach
	- The statistical approach is what is used by ChatGPT
		- It pulls patterns from the training data and uses it to generate very "human" like texts
		- However, it doesn't mean the output is *correct* it is just *statistically possible*
	- The symbolic approach is what is used by Wolfram Alpha
		- It converts natural language into precise computation language and applies algorithm or built-in knowledge to solve it
	- The statistical approach is very poor at handling math
		- It can also *appear correct* because it can give a plausible explanation that sounds correct but is actually wrong
		- Or when not *understanding the underlying facts* can lead to wrong answers
	- Can one train a big enough neural network to do anything?
		- Fundamental facts about computation (computational irreducibility) makes it clear that this is not possible
