## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #til2023 Kona Coffee
	- Grown exclusively on Kona, Hawaii on the Big Island
	- First planted by Don Francisco de Paula Marin in 1817 and popularized by Samuel Ruggles in 1828
		- Started to switch the local sugar plantation owners over to growing coffee
		- But destroyed by weather and pests in 1850s
	- Hermann Widemann in 1892 planted a variety of Guatemalan bean, which is called Kona Typica today
		- Then coffee prices crashed in 1899 which caused most of coffee growers to switch back to sugar again
		- Brought back into popularity during WWII and created another boom in the industry on Kona
	- Micheal Norton sold cheap coffee under the name "100% Kona Coffee" during 1993 and 1996
		- The coffee farmers of Kona formed the Kona Coffee Council to protect the quality and reputation of Kona Coffee
	- Quality and standard for Kona Coffee
		- Must be hand-picked
		- Grown on volcanic soil in the Kona region full of nitrates, phosphates, iron, and manganese
		- Harvested late in season to ensure ripeness
		- The western slopes of Big Island where Kona is located also provides the ideal environment for coffee growing as the plants get abundant sun but also protection from flooding and excess sun from the hills and clouds
- #til2023 Pleonasm
	- Redundancy in words
		- Sometimes it is intentionally used to create emphasis but sometimes it is a result of incorporating foreign words either through trade, travel or colonialism
	- Few we are all familiar with are "Chai tea", "Naan bread" or "Queso cheese"
	- But there are a lot more examples
		- Geography related
			- The El Capitan -> The "the" Capitan
			- Lake Tahoe -> Lake **Da ow** a ga -> Lake "edge of the lake"
			- Lake Michigan -> Lake Michigama -> Lake "large lake"
			- Mississippi River -> Misi-sipi River -> "Big river" River
		- Sports related
			- The Los Angeles Angles -> The "the" "angles" Angles
		- Acronym related
			- PIN number
			- Please RSVP
			- SI System
			- RAM memory
	- #til2023 A* algorithm
		- A weighted Dijkstra's algorithm that makes it much more efficient
		- The weighting can be thought of as changing the height or potential of the nodes based on the distance to destination and results in changing the bidirectional edge's length
