## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #til2023 Drunk bears in Montana
	- There is a railroad near Glacier National Park where the trains sometimes spill grain and it gets fermented. The bears in the area would come an get drunk off the fermented grain and either try to outrun the train on the track or would be wasted on the track causing many deaths
	- No preventative action as been actively taken right now because the rail company believe that grizzly bears will be delisted
		- Of the measures that were discussed the only one that seems reasonable is to not load the train in a way that would cause spillage
- #programming Instead of saying "best practice" you are probably doing one of these four
	- Community pattern
		- How everyone in the community is doing it, it makes this the "best practice" because everyone in the community can read it understand immediately why
	- Readability pattern
		- It might take more lines but for the sake of readability
	- Performance pattern
	- Guardrail pattern
		- No magic numbers
		- No known foot guns
	- #til2023 Footgun
		- A programming joke for a feature that results in the user shooting themself in the foot
