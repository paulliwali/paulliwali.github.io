## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #til2023 Schrodinger's Cat
	- It was a criticism of Copenhagen's interpretation which included the idea that quantum mechanics is intrinsically indeterministic
	- Erwin Schrodinger came up with this paradoxical example to illustrate the absurdity of the Copenhagen's interpretation where the cat can be *simultaneously* alive and dead in the box that contains a radiation monitor which can release poison
	- The collapse of the states happens when one looks into the box but when exactly the quantum superposition end
	- However, the common understanding of the reference today is that it is an explainer for quantum mechanics
- #til2023 Madeira Wine
	- Fortified wine made on the Portuguese Medeira Islands by oxidizing the wine through heat and ageing
	- This produces wine that can be stored for a lone time, for decades and even centuries
		- The oldest known vintage is a 1715 Terrantez
	- Solera process is a way to age liquids by fractional blending of older products with younger ones to increase the average age
		- It means "on the ground" in Spanish because the fractional blending transfers from between barrels from the top to bottom
- #til2023 Why is the Napa Valley is a great place to grow grapes for wine
	- Diuaral temperature range
		- The big temperature swing from day to night allows for the grapes to ripen for longer on the vine as the low temperature pauses the growth of the grapes
		- This gives the grapes a "long hang time" to develop more flavour for wine
		- The temperature swing comes from the cooling effect from the Pacific Ocean
		- Winegrowers will use fans to move the hotter air above the ground down during very cold nights to prevent frost from forming
	- Diversity of soil types
		- As a result of geological activity 150 million years ago
		- It is also well-drained and deep
	- Policy
		- It has become the first agricultural reserve in the US in 1968 which has stringent protections of the land for wine growing only
- #til2023 Roses at the end of vineyard rows
	- There are several explanations but could be urban legends
	- Disease detection system
		- Roses are more sensitive to disease or insect infestation and could serve as an early warning system for the health of the vineyard
		- But winegrowers have also said if there are insects on the roses there is probably not enough time to protect the grapes
	- Turn signal for the horses or oxen
		- Back when farm animals were used, roses were used to ensure they don't cut across the rows and damage the grapes
