## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #til2023 Ergodicity
	- An ergodic system is when the average outcome of a cohort is the **same** as the average outcome of the individual over time
		- For example, if there are 100 gamblers in a casino and they making bets with the odds that 1/100 gamblers will go bankrupt. But this means that, if gambler number 28 goes bust, it has no effect on gambler number 29. Using the standard cost-benefit analysis - this would have a good expected average return
		- However, if this is applied to a single person across 100 days with the same odds. This person can go bust on day 28 and have no money for future days.
		- This meant that the ensemble probability can't be applied to the time probability of a single individual
	- Usually, financial decisions assume ergodic system when real life is non-ergodic
		- For example, a often used financial planning tool for retirement assumes a constant rate of return in investment. However, if you layer in the actual sequence of rate of return that average out to the constant rate - you can be in a situation where you run out of money sooner than expected
	- Relating to the idea from Nassim Taleb's book [[Antifragile]], there is an idea that some things respond negatively to volatility while others respond positively.
		- Things that respond positively are antifragile and also ergodic
