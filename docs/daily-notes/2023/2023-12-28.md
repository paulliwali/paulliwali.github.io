## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #til2023 Six nines in pi
	- A famous coincidence that at the 762nd decimal place of pi there are 6 nines
	- Sometimes called "Feynman point" but it is not clear when this is referenced
	- The position of first 9 repeated nines is at 564,665,206
- #til2023 Diehard tests
	- A battery of statistical tests for the randomness quality of a random number generator
	- Side note: true randomness is unintuitive to us because we are sensitive to patterns
		- We would see repeated numbers as patterns and assume true "randomness" should give us new and yet to be seen numbers
		- But if we used common sense and imagine there is a fair six-sided dice, after a number has appeared the probability that the next roll will be a new one would not change, especially not increased
		- A common user expectation for Spotify shuffle or random photo function is to not have repeated results but in reality the true random behavior would be for the results to be repeated more often as more of the results are discovered
	- Developed by George Marsaglia in 1995 and extended to the dieharder tests
	- Some interesting things
		- Birthday spacings: the spacing between the points should be asymptotically exponentially distributed - based on the birthday paradox
		- Monkey tests: treat sequence of some number of bits as "words", and the number of "words" that do not appear should follow a known distribution - based on the infinite monkey theorem
- #til2023 Wiki
	- Hawaiian word for "quick"
	- The free shuttle bus at the Honolulu Airport is named Wiki Wiki Shuttle, which is an example of repeating a word for emphasis known as epizeuxis or palilogia
	- The first wiki, user-editable website was named WikiWikiWeb as the creator Ward Cunningham originally intended to name it QuickWeb
	- Wikipedia is a portmanteau of wiki and encyclopedia
- #til2023 Gaslight
	- A popular slang that means someone is psychologically manipulating you to cause you to question your own memories and perception of reality
	- An example would be someone blatantly lying about a shared experience which contradict the memories of the victim to convince them that the victim is actually crazy or overreacting
	- This colloquialism is derived from a 1944 film with the same title where the female protagonist's new husband is dimming gaslights in secret to drive her mad
