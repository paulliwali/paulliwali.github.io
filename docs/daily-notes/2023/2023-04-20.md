## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- How rocket engines work
	- Rocket engines expels gas to propel the rocket forward
	- The engine contains a combustion chamber and rocket nozzle (de Laval nozzle)
		- Converts hot subsonic high-pressure gas that was in the chamber to cooler supersonic lower-pressure gas in the exhaust
		- The higher the pressure and temperature inside the engine the better 
		- $H = E + (P \times V)$
		- Where $H$ is enthalpy or the total energy in the system, $E$ is internal energy, $P$ is pressure and $V$ is volume
	- Cold gas thrusters are the simplest form of rocket engines
		- The gas is kept in a pressurized tank and it expels out from high pressure to low pressure 
		- The tank is cold because when gases expand out from high pressure the temperature drops due to Joule-Thompson effect
		- To store the most energy, a cold gas thruster needs to store as much propellant at the highest possible pressure in the lightest possible tank which is the biggest challenge
		- Example usage are the maneuvering thrusters on Falcon 9 interstage and on NASA's manned maneuvering units
	- Pressure fed engines
		- They can be monopropellant or bipropellant
		- The difference is that in addition to the pressure tank and exhaust valve, there is a propellant tank in between
		- This is more efficient because it utilizes the chemical energy from running the propellant over a chemical bed
