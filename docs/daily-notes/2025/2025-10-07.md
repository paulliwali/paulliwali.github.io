## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- Revamped my website drastically with [[Claude Code]]
	- Really a game changer in multiplying productivity from copilot
	- Never felt agent mode was that good at delivering bug free feature improvements
	- But adding bash tools into a while loop solves skips so many manual iterations
- #til2025 Resume driven development
	- Development based on creating better resume
	- Using complicated tech stacks, over engineered design in order to look impressive
	- "Ideas should be so simple that people are upset that they didn't come up with it"
