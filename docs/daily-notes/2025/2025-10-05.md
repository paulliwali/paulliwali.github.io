## üìù Ephemeral Notes

- #til2025 Liar's Poker
	- Game played at Solomon Brothers, a bond firm, that mimics the bond market
	- Similar to Liar's dice, except the numbers are generated by one-dollar bill
- #til2025 Markov Chains
	- Average outcome gets closer to expected numbers with independent events - Law of large numbers
		- only proved this for independent events
		- up until Andrey Markov, probability relied on this independence assumption
	- Andrey Markov (socialist, atheist) and Pavel Nekrasov (tsar, religious) argued whether mathematics can explain will of god and free will
		- Nekrasov: if you see the LLN then there must be independent events
			- Used Belgian Marriage dataset and other social statistics to argue that because we see convergence of statistics which is observing the LLN then the decisions causing such social events (marriage, crimes, etc) *must be independent*
				- Free will, thus, be *measured*
		- Markov: set out to prove dependent events can also follow the LLN
			- Used a poem to train a text prediction model and found that the probability of two letters that followed VV, CC, VC, or CV case occurred differently than if you computed their expected average *assuming independence* which is $P(C/V) \times P(C/V) != P(actual VV/CC/CV/VC)$ 
			- Built a model to make this dependent event prediction which is "markov chain" and showed that it can *follow the LLN as well*
		- "Free will is not necessary to do probability" - Markov proved that observing LLN statistics does not mean independent events
