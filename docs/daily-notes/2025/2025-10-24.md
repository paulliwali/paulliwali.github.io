## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #til2025 Shibboleth
	- Like a password that indicates you are part of a distinct group, usually a phrase or a word
	- Originates from a Hebrew word that means the part of the plant that contains the seed
		- Because of how Ephraimates pronounced `shin`, it was used to distinguish the survivors apart after invading them
	- Related to this word is "Scribbeleth", which is messy handwriting that can distinguish a group like doctors
	- Related to this is also the trending term "6-7"
- #til2025 6-7
	- A brainrot term that is almost shibboleth for gen-z/alpha to distinguish those "in the know"
		- It evolved from calling it out when 67 happens naturally in a conversation to acknowledging it without actually saying the phrase
	- It has gone through "semantic bleaching" and lost its original meaning to the point that when Google'd it refers to either a high crime street in Chicago or the height of Lamelo Ball as he endorsed popular video edits of his highlights with the "Doot Doot (6 7)" song as the background music
	- The original meaning in the song by Skrilla most likely refers to the police radio code used to notify a dead body 
- #til2025 Semantic bleaching
	- Linguistic process where a word or term loses its original spiciness and becomes weaker and generic over time
	- Some examples include: rawdogging, literally
- #til2025 Manufacturing tanks in peace times
	- It is important to keep the skilled labour of critical production working by maintaining a low rate of production so they don't become deskilled
- #til2025 Ortega Hypothesis vs Newton Hypothesis
	- Is the bulk of science advancements made by average scientists over time/volume vs by a few great scientists
	- Ironic thing is that it is named after Jose Ortega y Gasset who wrote in "The Revolt of the Masses" that astoundingly mediocre men of narrow specialties do most of the work of experimental science and he believed that progress is made by geniuses building on each other's work
		- For example, Albert Einstein drawings on the ideas of Immanuel Kant and Ernst Mach
	- Neither hypothesis have been definitively proven wrong
