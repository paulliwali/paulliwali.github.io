- #til2025 Rubbing mud
	- MLB doesn't use brand new baseballs, they prep the ball with mud to remove the sheen on the leather
	- A special variety of muck was discovered by Lena Blackburne in Burlington County along the Delaware river was used to prep the balls that had enough texture and didn't turn the balls black. It is still being used today after 75 years
