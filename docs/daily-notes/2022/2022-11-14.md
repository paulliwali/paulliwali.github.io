## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #crypto FTX Bankruptcy
  - FTX was the third-largest crypto exchange and it used client-money for investment in their sister company Alameda and distorted their evaluation by selling a small portion of their own token (FTT) and holding the rest
  - Biance held a large portion of their token and can tank their evaluation by dumping it onto the market and since they had no assets to back their client-money investments, they would not be able to fulfill customer withdraws
  - The CEOs (CZ and SBF) got into a fight and Binance CEO threatened to dump their token and ended in FTX getting bought out by Binance
    - Binance backed out and FTX had $900 million assets against $9 billion liabilities
  - Since then, lots of news unearthed the unethical and illegal behaviors FTX was doing
    - Raised concerns for other crypto exchanges and general public sentiment around crypto
    - AAX announced they are "pausing" customer withdraws due to privacy and security concerns and it seems like a ploy to delay a mass-withdraw while they gather capital
  - *How long will Cryto.com be the name of the LAL stadium name?*
