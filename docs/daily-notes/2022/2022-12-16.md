## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #til2022 Cocktail
  - Horse breeders used to push ginger knobs up the horses butt when showcasing their horses on the track to cock their tails up. This was believed to be a good indication that the horse had good vigor
  - Mixed drinks were limited to old fashions - spirit + sugar
  - When people had hangovers the next day, they used bitters as a medicinal supplement to suppress nausea and also drank some alcohol as "hair of the dog that bit you" to alleviate the hangover symptoms
  - Soon, bartenders would mix bitters with spirits to create this hangover cure drink that would "cock one's tail"
- #til2022 Hair of the dog that bit you
  - Stems from the practice of putting some hair on the wound from the dog that bit you to treat rabies
  - When applied to alcohol, it means to take the same alcohol you had to relieve hangover
