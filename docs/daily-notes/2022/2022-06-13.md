    - #til2022 Depeg
        - 🌐: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31720277
        - 💁‍♂️: Currency can be pegged to another by enforcing a fixed exchange rate - which stabilizes the currency and gives confidence for long-term predictability. Stable-coins are often pegged to the US dollar.
        - 🤔: Luna crash in May 2022 caused several other networks to also crash which caused Tether (A stable-coin) to be depegged from the US dollar. 
    - #til2022 Time Dilation Equation due to Velocity
        - 🌐: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation
        - 💁‍♂️: $$t'=\frac{t}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$
        - 🤔: Time dilation can be caused by a difference in the relative velocity between them (special relativistic "kinetic" time dilation) or to a difference in gravitational potential between their locations (general relativistic gravitational time dilation).
