    - Buffet and Graham Investing Principles [[investment]]
        - 0. Don't try to make your money investing. Learn a skill and develop it to get paid
        - 1. Find an undervalued company. Calculate the value of the company using DCF and be conservative - buy at a high discount rate
        - 2. Dollar cost average into your value picks and index funds
        - 3. Don't try to time the market ever. All your holdings should have a large enough time horizon that **even a 3-year bear market is a blip on your radar**
        - "If you want three opinions, ask two economists looking at one set of data"
        - "Give me a one-handed economist! All my economists say 'on the one hand... and then on the other" - President Truman [[quotes]]
    - Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model
        - Valuation method to estimate the value of an investment based on expected future cash flows
            - Similar to net present value (NPV) except that it doesn't deduct the upfront cost of the investment
        - $$DCF=\frac{CF_1}{1+r^1}+\frac{CF_2}{1+r^2}+...+\frac{CF_n}{1+r^n}$$
        - Where $$r$$ is the discount rate and $$CF$$ is the cash flow for the given year
        - Assumptions on the future cash flow is where the art of prediction comes in
        - The dividend discount model such as Gordon Growth Model is using CDF to value stocks
        - Procedure
            - 1. Forecast the expected cash flow
            - 2. Select a discount rate - based on the cost of financing the project or the opportunity cost presented by alternative investments
            - 3. Discount the forecasted cash flow back to present day to compare against initial investment
