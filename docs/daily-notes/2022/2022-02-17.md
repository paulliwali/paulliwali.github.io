- ☀️Daily Log:
    - #programming #braindump Good starter project to do
        - write a scraper in Python, you can scrape whatever you want, stock data, sports team data, some other hobby, etc.
        - massage/chunk that data into a database (relational (MySQL), time series(InfluxDB), whatever)
        - setup something else to analyze/visualize that data (grafana/etc.)
        - this will help you learn
            - how to write basic python
            - interact with APIs
            - manipulate data
            - basics of a database
            - updating/deploying your python app
            - integrations with the database (SQL queries)
            - if you set it up in AWS or whatever then some cloud technologies
    - #tax Update the cost basis for sell-to-cover stock vests using the supplemental 1099 form
    - #tax there a reason to delay exercising the ISOs? I was previously thinking that it makes more sense to wait as long as possible because the cash needed for strike could be invested elsewhere. Let that grow, and use a smaller portion of the funds to exercise. However, if there are additional tax implications, seems like ripping off the bandaid makes a lot of sense and get the clock started.
        - you should regularly exercise ISOs to get the clock started on LTCG and to spread out your cash outlay, and to mitigate the AMT hit (if any)
        - the problem with waiting and then exercising in one big transaction is that your cash outlay will be large, your AMT hit could be large
