    - Revisit Resolutions from last year
        - [[Raise a üê∂]]
            - Raising Nobo has been an absolute joy, she is a trusting, sweet, and curious dog who is very keen on learning new things and making me happy
            - For this year I need to continue her training with new tricks and advancing current ones because I do feel like I slowed down in challenging her mentally
            - I made a video of her with footages from her first few months
        - Hike [[John Muir Trail]]
            - COVID and raising a dog made this hard to achieve
        - Finish a Data Science related online degree
            - Started a learning path page but didn't make significant progress
        - Meditation for a minimum of 3 times a week
            - Calm in review said I completed 41 sessions which is just under 1 session a week, I think we can bring this number up for this year
    - Technology that was suppose to change my life in 2021
        - Pandemic inspired technology
            - Better webcams
                - I don't think anything beyond laptop included was really needed
                - Macbooks improved their webcam but nothing astounding
            - Portable UV cleaners
                - Don't really see this in practice
        - ARM chips
            - Second gen of macbooks are even better
            - Tensor chips are good
            - But not as many tech giants have made the switch yet in 2021
        - Hollywood at home
            - Lots of home releases for big budget movies
            - But once theatres opened, lots of showings are still in theatres
        - Death by subscription
            - More services will move to subscription model and tied to hardware purchases
            - I have seen increases in subscription costs but not "death"
        - Return of the trust fall
            - Companies hosting remote retreats
            - Did not really experience this myself
