    - #data-science Spatio-Temporal Extreme Event Modelling of Terror Insurgencies
        - Authors: Lekha Patel
        - Highly unpredictable but high impact outcome events are important to predict accurately
            - Arbitrary space-time region
            - Inhomogeneous baseline intensity
        - Self-exciting marked spatio-temporal model
            - Triggering intensity is modelled with Gaussian Process prior distribution to flexibly capture intricate spatio-temporal dependencies between an arbitrary event and previous events
            - Novel generalized zipf distribution to measure the intensity of the event
            - customized Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate the model parameters
        - **Extreme value analysis focuses on the characterization of events that lies at the tails of a distribution**
            - i.e. earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, wildfires
            - Two common approaches from statistical point of view
                - calculating a sequence of maximum (minimum) values over blocks of data and fitting these values to their large sample distribution (the Generalized extreme value distribution)
                - find observations that exceeds (fall below) a given threshold and fits the Generalized pareto distribution to these exceedance values (Peaks over Threshold method (PoT))
            - A novel approach is to use point process modelling
                - Used to probabilstically describe an event that happens in space-time
                - Homogeneous point process can be used if the event occurs in a constant rate
                - Self-exciting processes can be used to capture dependencies that naturally arise in events that may have connections
            - To measure the different impact of these events, layered a mixture model to estimate the discrete mark of the event
                - Marks above a threshold can be modelled with a Generalized-Zipf distribution
        - ==It is similar to a two-hurdle model except the first hurdle is the self-exciting point process and the second hurdle is a generalized zipf model==
