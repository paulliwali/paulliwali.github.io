        - üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: "It is faster to make a four-inch mirror then a six-inch mirror than to make a six-inch mirror" - Programming Pearls #quotes
        - ü§î: The jump to make a larger product is considerable and it is easier to develop the skills needed for smaller product and iterate to the larger product
            - The parallel to this is in autonomous driving where there are two schools of thoughts:
                - Iterate autonomous driving from manual driving to fully autonomous - i.e. Tesla
                - Jump directly to fully autonomous driving - i.e. Waymo
            - The rationale for jumping directly to autonomous driving is that it is like building lego from simple structures to complex structures but you can never make the leap to building actual rockets
            - __It depends on how one views the jump from level 4 to level 5 autonomous driving__
