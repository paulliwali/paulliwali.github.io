    - #til2022 Sentinel Value or "Elephant in Cairo"
        - üåê: https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/sentinel-value/m097vbz?hl=en
        - üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: A __special__ placeholder value used in programming like `-1` or `999` to represent termination or `null` values
        - ü§î: One should be very careful choosing a sentinel value that is unique in form and won't naturally appear in data or algorithm, for this reason it is also sometimes called "elephant in Cairo"
```python
# Go to Africa.
# Put an elephant in Cairo.
# Start at the Cape of Good Hope.
# Work northward in an orderly manner, traversing the continent alternately east and west,
# During each traverse pass:
#     Catch each animal seen.
#     Compare each animal caught to a known elephant.
#     Stop when a match is detected.
# If you are in Cairo, then there are no elephants in Africa (other than the one you placed there).
```
