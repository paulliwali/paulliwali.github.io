        - 💁‍♂️: The symbol `&` was not always a symbol but a letter - the 27th letter that was a ligature of `e` and `t` which is `et` or `and` in Latin.
            - The phrase ampersand came from the fact that there are letters like `I` and `A` that can also function as a word. So when you are referring to the use of the letter and not the word, you would use the phrase 'I per say, I", which meant "I by itself, I". When used on the quasi-letter `&`, the phrase becomes "& per say, and" -> "and per say, and" -> "ampersand"
