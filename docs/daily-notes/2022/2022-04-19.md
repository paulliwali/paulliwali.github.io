    - Summary: 
        - By the end of 2021, 56 countries had registered more deaths per capita from COVID-19 than Sweden, a country that had not imposed lockdown mandate 
        - There seems to be a lack of retrospective on Sweden's policy and if that was the right choice
        - There is an overestimation of the death toll caused by COVID-19, and compared to things like hunger it was much less severe
    - Notes:
        - This rosy figure is not so rosy when compared against other nordic countries that did go into lockdown
        - Also it doesn't consider the demographic that it affects and it disproportionality kills people who __are healthy__

    - Summary:
        - One should increase the rate of experiment in order to arrive at the results
            - Accepted fact that __we don't know about the customer__
        - Provide basic tools for setting up an experiment
            - Determine what sample size is needed for 80% power and 99% stat sig level for a particular kind of experiment
        - Standard set of metrics
            - And avoid pitfalls like sample ratio mismatch
        - Standard dashboards, analysis and reporting structure
            - It pays off to have standardized analysis
        - User bucketing
            - Having equal user buckets which have similar baseline performance
            - Clean control group
            - **data hygiene** - making sure user groups do not have any residual effect, doing A/A experiment 
        - Track the rate of experimentation and set groals around it
