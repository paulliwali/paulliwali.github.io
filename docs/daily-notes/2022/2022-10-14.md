        - 💁‍♂️: They are prime-lookalikes that passes Pierre de Fermat's "little theorem" inspired prime test
            - Little theorem - "if N is a prime number, then $$b^N -b$$ is always a multiple of N"
            - Prime test - the reverse of Little theorem be a test for prime, that by checking $$b^N -b$$ is a multiple of N for all values of b, then N must be prime
            - The composite numbers that breaks this prime test is known as Carmichael Numbers and the smallest of such numbers is 561
            - More concretely, the Carmichael Numbers are defined by Korselt's criterion
        - 🤔: It was proven that there are __also__ infinite amount of these numbers but mathematicians have no idea how they are distributed
            - A 17 year old teenager named Daniel Larsen showed a proof to determine if a gap will contain a Carmichael number that was not limited to very large numbers
