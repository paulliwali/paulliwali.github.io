## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #til2024 The Law of Leaky Abstractions
	- A law by Joel Spolsky - https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/
	- All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky
	- They save us time from working but don't save us time from learning
		- Because they will eventually fail and we have to know why
	- Is LLM just an leaky abstraction of programming? Can it ever really replace it?
- #til2024 Bulkhead
	- A safety design in ships that prevents catastrophic failure if there is a leak in the hull
	- It creates separate watertight compartments to limit the effect of a leak and ensure resiliency of the ship
	- Used in reactive microsystems design to prevent large scale failures
