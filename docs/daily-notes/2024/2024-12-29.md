## üìù Ephemeral Notes

- Noting down the option exercise plans in 2024 for my stocks #tax
	- The estimated AMT limit for me this year is around $49,000 above my income
	- [[2024-10-28]] exercised 200 @ $270 market price and $166 strike price
		- Did a cashless exercise which **is a mistake** because the stocks sold to fund the exercise incurred short term capital gains
		- Next time the strategy is to sell LT holdings and hold the cash to do cash-to-cover exercise
	- [[2024-12-13]] sold 24 @ $428 for 10k gross and 2k LTCG
		- Had 5k of losses to offset 
		- Using this to fund the next exercise
	- [[2024-12-16]] cash exercised 40 @ $439 market price and $166 strike price
- Reviewing notes from [[2022-02-17]] and reminded the truth that there is no reason to delay exercising if you think stocks will eventually be 1.5x the strike price
	- lessens the AMT burden 
	- starts the clock on LTCG (the **most important factor** to reduce taxes)
