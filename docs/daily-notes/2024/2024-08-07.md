## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #til2024 Arena
	- Possibly borrowed from the latin word hasena which means sand
	- The ancient Romans used this kind of sand on the floors of the Colosseum to soak up the blood
		- Which is then taken up to mean a place of combat and slowly evolved to the place of sporting event as used today
- #til2024 Ad nauseam 
	- I've always mistakenly thought this word was spelled "at nauseum" like it is discussed to a point of nausea
- #til2024 Hyperion
	- The name given to the tallest living redwood tree in California
		- measuring at 115.9 meters tall
		- between 600-800 years old
		- its location is a "secret" and is under protection
- #til2024 Closed cities
	- A city or town that is completely restricted and only special authorizations is allowed to enter
	- These could be military bases like Los Alamos during the Manhattan project
	- There are several of these in Soviet Union during the Cold War but continue to operate after the dissolution of the Soviet Union
	- "Mailbox" was the unofficial name of secret Soviet facilities
- Reading [[Reactive Microsystems]]
	- Introduced by the EPS team as a good primer read on good system designs for data intensive applications
