## üìù Ephemeral Notes

- Trying out [aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) as the windows tiling manager instead of [rectangle]
	- I've been using rectangle on my mac for the past few years and it's fast and simple key-binds was good enough for most tasks
	- The difference with aerospace is that it auto tiles the new windows based on rules and configuration and provides a lot more "workspaces" to organize
