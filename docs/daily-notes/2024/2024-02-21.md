## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #til2024 Tar (computer)
	- A computer utility that puts a collection of files into one archived file
		- Known as a "tarball" which comes from the fact that the literal ball of tar can be very sticky and have random things stuck to it
	- The name was derived from "tape archive" because that utility was created to write data to I/O devices that did not have file systems and used magnetic tapes. And for those systems it was more efficient for tape drives to read fixed length data blocks and larger file blocks. So that concept was used here.
