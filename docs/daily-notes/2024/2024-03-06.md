## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #python #programming Dictionary vs Dataclasses
	- When choosing between a dictionary and dataclass structure in Python, there are a few considerations but one should remember that a dataclass is comprised of dictionaries under the hood
	1. Purpose - dictionary is a mapping type structure while a dataclass is a record type structure
	2. Function - dictionary is mean to be updated and mutable while dataclasses allow instances to be immutable upon creation, and prevents attributes from being removed or added. There are also better type hint support 
	3. Efficiency - because dictionaries are simpler it is faster
