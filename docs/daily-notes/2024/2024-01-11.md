## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- #til2024 Embarrassingly Parallel
	- A workload that is parallelizable with little or no effort because the tasks are independent and require no communication
	- They are different from distributed workloads that require communication between tasks
	> Weird use of "embarrassingly" because it didn't sound good at first, which the common alternative term "pleasingly" parallel is aiming to fix
- Polars #data-science #programming 
	- https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/
	- Alternative to Pandas 
	- Similar to spark, with lazy evaluations and streaming to optimize memory on large datasets
	- It is entirely based on Arrow datatypes and backed by Arrow memory array
		- Except `String` is actually `LargeUtf8`
		- :o explicit string type!!
	- The domain specific language is similar to Pandas with context (to filter and transform data) and expressions (to operate on the dataframe)
	- Unique
		- Folds
		- Structs
		- Expression plugins to compile a Rust function
	- Start a doc to track interesting notes from transitioning from pandas [[Pandas to Polar(bear)s]]
