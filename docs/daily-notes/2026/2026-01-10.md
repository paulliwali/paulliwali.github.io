## 📝 Ephemeral Notes

- Read https://addyosmani.com/blog/21-lessons/
	- Best engineers are those that can navigate the things around code: people, politics, alignment and ambiguity
	- Understand user problems deeply and then let solutions emerge from that understanding
		- It is easy to be a magpie and be seduced by a new technology
		- Allows the engineer who truly understand user pain to find the elegant solution
	- Bias towards action
		- You can edit a bad page, but you can't edit a blank one
	- Code doesn't advocate for you, people do
	> Decisions are made in meetings you are not invited to, using summaries you didn't write - if no one can articulate your impact when you're not in the room - your impact is effectively optional

	- "Slow" teams are just misaligned teams
		- Teams are units of concurrency, coordination costs grow geometrically as teams multiply
	- Abstraction don't remove complexity, they move it to the day you are on call 
		- LOL I legit laughed at this statement at how true this feels
		- Abstraction is a bet that you won't need to understand what is underneath
	- Teaching is debugging your own mental model
	- Turn glue work like documentation, onboarding, process improvement into artifacts that is visible and legible
		- Priceless and invisible is a dangerous combination
	- Real alignment takes time
		- Winning debates doesn't mean because others are convince it means they have given up
	- Every metric should be paired with one that measures quality or risk
	- Invest in networking and relationships because that will outlast your job
